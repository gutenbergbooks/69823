</div>


<p>After more than three decades of work in preventive
medicine and public health, the opportunity has arisen
in connection with a year’s visit to America, to take a
panoramic view of public health in England, of the
progress which has been secured, of the factors which
have impeded progress, and of the pressing desiderata
for more efficient future action.</p>

<p>During my stay in America I have had the privilege
of addressing public audiences in every part, from New
Orleans to Toronto, and from New York and Boston
to San Francisco and Seattle; as well as more special
audiences at Johns Hopkins University, at Saranac and
at Harvard, California, Washington, and Yale Universities;
and at the request of many friends some of
the addresses given to these audiences are now published
in volume form. These addresses briefly outline
some of the lessons of long experience, and
although the conditions under which they were delivered
rendered complete exposition impracticable,
there are, I think, advantages in not overloading the
presentation for public consideration of a many-sided
subject.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the same problem may be mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
in several addresses, though usually from a different
angle. The entire avoidance of repetition would
have necessitated the abandonment of the lecture
form, and would, I believe, have diminished the utility
of the volume. The table of contents and index render
cross-reference easy.</p>

<p>Those wishing to ascertain fuller details on most of
the problems discussed in the present volume may refer,
I think with advantage, to my annual reports as
Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, England,
and to my four special reports on Maternal and
Child Mortality, which also were issued as English
Government publications.</p>

<p>British experience is only partially applicable in the
United States, the almost complete Home Rule in each
State creating a new and interesting problem in efficient
national public health administration. Nevertheless
a review of events in Great Britain cannot fail
to be useful in America, which is faced with similar
problems. The main lines of public health administration
in Great Britain have proved their value by their
success. There has been local independence with a
minimum of central control, and the people’s representatives
in every area have been made to realize their
commercial responsibility. The mistakes made in permitting
the multiplication of small and inefficient
public health authorities, in allowing official medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
work to be divided respectively between different local
and central authorities, in sanctioning the creation of
<em>ad hoc</em> authorities for special work, in associating state
medicine with monetary insurance against sickness, and
in not securing that insurance shall directly assist the
prevention of sickness, have been largely the mistakes
of politicians and of central authorities. These mistakes
involve the retracing of steps and the undoing of
the mischief resulting from ill-advised action. In
view of these conflicting events, the marvellous
achievements secured by public health authorities are
the more noteworthy.</p>

<p>In every American city visited by me I have been
struck with the earnest desire of voluntary and official
public health and social workers to profit by English
experience, to adopt what is good, to secure the abolition
of the short tenure of office of competent officers
under the present political system, and to introduce
civil service conditions for them. There is in many
respects a close parallelism between the course of
public health on both sides of the Atlantic; in some
cities the English hygienist has much to learn in respect
of advanced and original work; and in other
American cities in which “political pull” continues,
there is evidence of the development of a wider interest
and a more general sense of communal responsibility;
a deeper trend of thought which will make for steadily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
increasing efficiency in public health work. As this
volume discusses public health problems especially
from a social viewpoint, it is my earnest hope that it
may be useful in this direction.</p>

</div>

<p>After thirty-five years in active public health work
in England—during eleven of those years having been
the principal officer of its central public health department
on its medical side—I may be assumed to possess
some qualification for the task of reviewing the past
half century’s progress in public health in England.</p>


<h3><em>Parallelism of Events in New and Old England</em></h3>

<p>I find it, however, beyond my power to compass
in a short address a resumé of my subject which shall
be complete, or completely in perspective, or which
shall not omit features on which, had time permitted,
one would have wished to comment; and I must ask
you to remember that only a portion—and that chiefly
non-administrative<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—of the history of this wonderful
half century can be embraced within the present address.
The survey should, I think, take a panoramic
view of the story as it has developed, should note the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
changes as they have occurred, the obstacles which
impeded reforms as well as the reforms secured; and
should also, at least incidentally, state—in the light of
unfailing historical guidance, as well as of increasing
knowledge—the pressing desiderata for more efficient
and more rapid future progress. I cannot hope to
accomplish this task except to a fragmentary extent,
but I am happy to remember that sanitary history in
Old and in New England has proceeded largely on
parallel lines. The curves of annual death-rates from
all causes, from typhoid fever, from tuberculosis, and
of the mortality of infants show the closeness of the
parallelism of the public health history of England and
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The work of the last fifty years was built on preceding
pioneer work of men in Old and in New England;
and for a complete understanding of this work,
a momentary glance is required at the men of this
earlier generation and their work.</p>

<p>In the old country we speak with reverence of the
names of Southwood Smith, Kay, Chadwick, Farr and
Simon; and you remember with gratitude the names
of Lemuel Shattuck, of Bowditch, of Walcott, S. W.
Abbott, and Theobald Smith; and it is gratifying to
remember that the epoch-making report of the Massachusetts
Sanitary Commission of 1850—to which were
attached the ever memorable names of Shattuck, N. P.
Banks, and Jehiel Abbott—among its many statesmanlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and far-seeing proposals, recommended a sanitary
survey of the State, and referred to the recent English
sanitary surveys, with which British sanitation may be
said to have begun.</p>


<h3><em>The Utilisation of Lay Workers</em></h3>

<p>Let me in passing comment on the fact that neither
Lemuel Shattuck in Boston nor Edwin Chadwick in
London was a physician; but a perusal of their writings
shows that they were men of sound judgment, of
earnest zeal for their fellow men, with a wide and
statesmanlike outlook, ready to search out, to accept
and to apply the medical knowledge on which necessarily
the prevention of disease is based. They illustrate
once for all the need for partnership between all
well-wishers of humanity in this work, and the importance
of combined effort by the sociologist and the
physician, as well as of experts in each branch of sanitation,
if all attainable success is to be attained.</p>

<p>The tradition then established has never been lost.
In England, more perhaps than in America, the control
of public health work has been shared by intelligent
laymen on local and central authorities, and the fact
that medical officers of health have found it necessary
to convince these lay representatives of the general
public of the need for the reforms recommended, has
led to steady progress, seldom interrupted by relapses.
And this is true, although delays and disappointments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
have beset the path of the earnest reformer,
who might well wish that his lay colleagues had been
trained in schools in which natural science formed a
more open avenue to distinction than classics; or that
the representatives on local authorities might more
fully and more quickly appreciate in Simon’s words,
what they are</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">sometimes a little apt to forget that, for sanitary purposes,
they are also the appointed guardians of human beings whose
lives are at stake in the business.</p>
</div>

<p>What were the ideals with which the Fathers of
Sanitation in New and in Old England began their
work?</p>

<p>They cannot be better expressed than in their own
words. In the 1850 Report of the Massachusetts
Sanitary Commission they are thus expressed:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>We believe that the conditions of perfect health, either
public or personal, are seldom or never attained, though attainable;
that the average length of human life may be very
much extended, and its physical power greatly augmented;
that in every year, within this Commonwealth, thousands of
lives are lost which might have been saved; that tens of thousands
of cases of sickness occur, which might have been prevented;
that a vast amount of unnecessarily impaired health,
and physical debility, exists among those not actually confined
by sickness; that these preventible evils require an enormous
expenditure and loss of money, and impose upon the people
unnumbered and immeasurable calamities, pecuniary, social,
physical, mental, and moral, which might be avoided; that
means exist, within our reach, for their mitigation or removal;
and that measures for prevention will effect infinitely
more than remedies for the cure of disease.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>In a succeeding paragraph the Commissioners proceed
to quote with approval, the following remarks
made by Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Simon in the
preceding year, when he was medical officer of health
to the City of London, and before he became the principal
medical officer and adviser of the British Government
in health matters, and in that capacity laid the
foundation and built much of the edifice of our present
health organization.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Ignorant men may sneer at the pretensions of sanitary science;
weak and timorous men may hesitate to commit themselves
to its principles, so large is their application; selfish
men may shrink from the labour of change, which its recognition
must entail; and wicked men may turn indifferently
from considering that which concerns the health and happiness
of millions of their fellow-creatures; but in the great
objects which it proposes to itself, in the immense amelioration
which it proffers to the physical, social, and, indirectly, to
the moral conditions of an immense majority of our fellow
creatures, it transcends the importance of all other sciences;
and, in its beneficent operation, seems to embody the spirit,
and to fulfil the intentions, of practical Christianity.</p>
</div>

<p>With such noble ideals, what measure of success
crowned their efforts and those of their successors?</p>

<p>The earlier history I can only briefly mention, as we
are chiefly concerned today with events since 1869.
To understand these events, however, one must understand
the forces which had been accumulating and
increasing in power in earlier years, and which rendered
possible the rapid public health progress experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in the fourth quarter of the nineteenth and the
first quarter—so far as it has passed—of the twentieth
century.</p>


<h3><em>Laissez Faire Economic Teaching</em></h3>

<p>Historians in future generations will refer to the
second half of the eighteenth and the first half of the
nineteenth century as the period of unmitigated industrialism,
of associated rapid increase of urban at the
expense of rural life, and of the most extreme manifestation
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</i> economic science. The older
semi-paternal system of interference with the economic
life of the people by King and Parliament, was
replaced, under the influence of Adam Smith, Malthus,
James Mill, and other teachers, by inaction based on
the view that in old countries poverty is the natural
and inevitable result of pressure of population on
means of subsistence, and that any interference with
freedom of competition in obtaining work or employing
workers is useless or mischievous. A similar view
found expression in President Jefferson’s dictum: that
government is best which governs least; and until the
middle of the nineteenth century these views were generally
accepted and their influence was dominant.</p>

<p>It was assumed that given free competition, enlightened
self-interest would incite effort and improvement,
encourage self-reliance, and guarantee production and
economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Under the conditions considered inevitable with such
teaching, although great wealth accompanied the rapid
industrial development after the Napoleonic wars, it
was associated with unrelieved misery; for homeworkers
and rural workers crowded into mean hovels
in towns, paying exorbitant rents out of a miserable
pittance of wages, and were exposed to the evils resulting
from overcrowding, and from absence of adequate
and satisfactory water supply, scavenging or drainage.
By the year 1851 about half the population of England
and Wales had become aggregated in towns; and it
may be added that in 1911, less than one fourth of the
population was left in rural districts. Urbanization
in the earlier years meant dense overcrowding and insanitation;
and that it is still an influence adverse to
health may be gathered from the information given
by the census of 1911, that over eight times as large
a proportion of the urban as of the rural population
live in one-roomed tenements, and nearly twice as large
a proportion live in two-roomed tenements, while the
proportion of one-roomed tenements in towns which
are overcrowded (in the sense of having more than
two persons to a room) in towns is seven times as
great, and of two-roomed tenements is twice as great
as in country districts.</p>

<p>Domestic misery was associated with commensurate
industrial misery; overwork, in insanitary factories
and workshops, regardless of the health of the “hands,”
was the rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The displacement between 1760 and 1800 of domestic
by factory manufacture represented a new
phenomenon in the world’s history, a true industrial
revolution. It was the parting of the ages; destined
not only to change the life of the people of England
from preponderantly outdoor to preponderantly indoor;
and to bring for them for many years all the
disadvantages of unregulated town life; but also,
owing to the rapid development of better roads, of
canals, and then of railroads and steamships to end
forever the practical segregation in which countries,
and even neighbouring communities, had previously
lived.</p>

<p>It cannot be wondered at that under these circumstances
the general death-rate was excessive, and epidemic
disease spread with a rapidity and to an extent
previously unknown.</p>

<p>The reaction against the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</i> economic
teaching began early, and it is in accordance with the
fitness of things that the national conscience first rebelled.
The earliest evidence of reform was legislation
in 1802 on behalf of pauper children indentured
to the overseers in textile factories; and there followed
subsequent Factory and other Acts in 1819, in 1833,
in 1844 and in 1847, which prohibited the factory employment
of children under nine, limited the hours of
labour of young persons and of women, and insisted
on elementary sanitation in factories. Subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Factory and Mining Acts, followed by Shop Hours
Acts and the Shop Seats’ Act, have completed a most
valuable code of regulations prohibiting overwork,
and securing a measure of protection against dangers
to health and limb or eyesight during industrial employment.
It is noteworthy that the first steps at improved
sanitation, and to safeguard health by preventing
overwork, were on the industrial plane. Factory
inspectors preceded medical officers of health and sanitary
inspectors appointed by local authorities.</p>

<p>Philanthropy was the motive power in initiating factory
reform; in securing general sanitary reform, driving
power was furnished by the double motive of
economy and fear, caused by the inordinate expense
of poor-law administration, the frequently recurring
epidemics of “fever,” and the alarming occasional invasions
of Asiatic cholera. The sacrifices of life from
cholera were truly vicarious; for we owe it largely to
these that our national system of vital statistics was
initiated in 1837 and that serious efforts at sanitary
reform were begun.</p>


<h3><em>Man and His Environment</em></h3>

<p>The history of these earlier steps is full of interest;
but I cannot outline it today. There can be no doubt
that as Simon<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> put it, referring to Dr. Southwood
Smith’s report to the Poor-Law Commissioners in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
1838 (“on Some of the Physical Causes of Sickness
and Mortality to which the Poor are particularly exposed,
and which are capable of removal by Sanitary
Regulations”)</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">the commencement of State interference on behalf of the
health of the labouring classes may be said to date from its
publication and to have been in a very important degree determined
by its facts and arguments.</p>
</div>

<p>That the first principles of causation were beginning
to be appreciated is shown in the following extract
from Queen Victoria’s speech in opening Parliament
in 1849. In this speech she referred to the ravages
of cholera which it had pleased Almighty God to arrest,
and added:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Her Majesty is persuaded that we shall best evince our
gratitude by vigilant precautions against the more obvious
causes of sickness, and an enlightened consideration for those
who are most exposed to its attacks.</p>
</div>

<p>Note that these words and the early attempts at public
health legislation, culminating in our great sanitary
code, the Public Health Act, 1875, incorporated the
tripod on which enlightened public health administration
must always be supported, viz.,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(1) attack on the causes of sickness,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(2) satisfactory treatment of the sick, and</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(3) satisfactory care for the poor.</span><br>
</p>

<p>I might properly add</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(4) attack on the causes of poverty,</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>for it is perhaps the chief merit of the great work of
Edwin Chadwick that, in the light of reports on local
surveys made by Kay, Southwood Smith, and others,
he was convinced and was able to convince Parliament
that a very large share of the total destitution then existing
was due to the conditions under which the people
lived, and the disease generated in these conditions.</p>

<p>It is commonly stated that, in the past, public health
administration has concerned itself solely with mankind’s
environment, failing to recognise the predominant
importance of man himself as a transmitter of
disease, and of his personal well-being and protection
as the point to which energy should be directed. This
cannot be said to have been the intention of the legislature
or of the earlier reformers; though unhappily this
limited view received official acceptance, in large measure
owing to the increasing incompatibility between
poor-law and public health administration and the
spreading over from poor-law to public health administration
of the general influence of “deterrence” as a
motive of administration. As time went on, this principle
came to be realised as contrary to the general
interest in anything which concerns the health of the
community.</p>


<h3><em>Dirt and Disease</em></h3>

<p>The crude generalization emerging from the earlier
surveys was the close relation between filth conditions
and excessive sickness; and the motive behind these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
inquiries was the desire to remove one of the chief
causes of destitution.</p>

<p>So late as 1874 Simon said “filth is the deadliest of
our present removable causes of disease”; and throughout
the whole series of his vividly worded and influential
reports, the same fundamentally important
teaching was urged.</p>

<p>Chadwick’s earlier reports were similarly influenced
by the teaching of Dr. Southwood Smith and his collaborators,
to the effect that epidemic diseases as a
whole are the direct consequence of local insanitary
conditions. This generalization, as we now know,
needs a modified and more accurate statement, specialized
for each individual disease. In its original form,
however, it embodied a realisation of the immense importance
of the environment to make or to mar individual
and national life; it secured the beginning of
our national sanitary improvements, and it laid the
foundations of the house of health which as nations
we are still building.</p>

<p>The three diseases which were especially regarded
as due to filth were cholera, typhus, and enteric fever;
and the history of public health in England is largely
concerned with these three diseases.</p>


<h3><em>Cholera</em></h3>

<p>The general view then held in New as in Old England
is well stated in the following extract from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Report of the Massachusetts Sanitary Commission,
1850:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Atmospheric contagion is generally harmless unless attracted
by local causes ... that terrible disease, Asiatic Cholera,
derives its terrific power chiefly or entirely from the accessory
or accompanying circumstances which attend it. It bounds
over habitation after habitation where cleanliness abides;
... while it alights near some congenial abode of filth or
impurity.... Wherever there is a dirty street, court, or
dwelling-house, the elements of pestilence are at work in that
neighbourhood.</p>
</div>

<p>And the important moral is drawn that</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">the person who permits his neighbour’s atmosphere to be contaminated
by any filth ... is worse than a highway robber.
The latter robs us of property, the former of life.</p>
</div>

<p>Similarly, Simon in England was teaching that “in
order to the prevention of Filth Diseases, the prevention
of filth is indispensable”; and that there was need
for local authorities “to introduce for the first time,
as into savage life, the rudiments of sanitary civilization.”</p>

<p>The crude generalization that filth causes disease
perhaps persisted too long, and the value of Snow’s
investigation in 1855 of the outbreak of Cholera in
the area of supply of the Broad Street pump was
perhaps too slowly appreciated. The influence of
Von Pettenkofer’s theories on the relation between
subsoil conditions and Cholera was largely responsible
for this delay; but already in 1856 Simon had accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the importance of water infection, giving as his general
conclusion that</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">under the specific influence which determines an epidemic
period, fecalised drinking water and fecalised air equally may
breed and convey the poison (of Cholera).</p>
</div>

<p>Still it will be noted there persisted the notion of
aerial convection of the contagia of cholera and enteric
fever, in addition to their convection by dirt, by flies,
or the more common contamination of hands or feet
or food by faecal matter; but the importance of water
supplies was beginning to be appreciated. Already in
1883 local authorities in England and Wales had outstanding
loans for waterworks amounting to twenty-nine
million and for sewerage amounting to fifteen
million pounds sterling, while between 1883 and 1912
they expended out of rates and by means of loans one
hundred and thirty-one millions for waterworks and
eighty-nine millions sterling for sewerage.</p>

<p>Although we realise now the greater importance of
control of excreta from persons specifically infected,
we must agree with Simon that communally</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Nowhere out of Laputa could there be serious thought of
differentiating excremental performances into groups of diarrhœal
and healthy.... It is excrement, indiscriminately, that
must be kept from fouling us with its decay.... It is to be
hoped that ... for a population to be thus poisoned by its
own excrement, will some day be deemed ignominious and
intolerable.</p>
</div>

<p>And it is still opportune to draw attention to the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
responsibility incurred by local authorities when
they distribute a general supply of water to the inhabitants
of their area without taking every possible precaution
against contamination. The conveniences and
advantages of public water supplies “are countervailed
by dangers to life on a scale of gigantic magnitude”;
and sanitary history, in the calamitous experience of
Lincoln, Maidstone, and Worthing and of Lowell and
other towns and districts, has given remarkable illustrations
of the need for eternal vigilance.</p>


<h3><em>Typhoid Fever</em></h3>

<p>With the differentiation of typhoid fever from
typhus fever by Gerhard in Philadelphia in 1837, and
by Stewart and W. Jenner in Great Britain in 1849, it
became possible to associate the former with excremental,
the latter with respiratory filth, “the non-removal
of the volatile refuse of the human body.”
The question still remained whether typhoid fever was
producible by “emanations from decomposing organic
matter,” whether it was “often generated spontaneously
by faecal fermentation,” as contended by
Murchison, who in 1858 proposed the name “pythogenic
fever” for typhoid fever; or whether as indicated
by the remarkable observations of William Budd
of Bristol, the introduction of specific infection from a
typhoid patient was needed to start a local outbreak.
Gradually it became clear that specific contamination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
was necessary to start an outbreak or even to cause a
single case of this disease, and between 1870 and 1880
a number of water-borne outbreaks were traced. It
also gradually became evident that, however objectionable
or even noxious might be the gaseous emanations
from leaky drains or sewers, they did not cause typhoid
fever or diphtheria. Hence the statement, for instance,
of Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1862 (quoted for
its historical interest by Dr. Sedgwick) that “the bills
of mortality are more obviously affected by drainage
than by this or that method of practice,” which expressed
universal opinion when it was written, is now
known to be accurate only when specific matter from
drains contaminates milk or water supplies, or causes
infection by actual contact.</p>

<p>With the general recognition of the causal relation
between impure water supplies and typhoid fever came
the rapid provision of public supplies, on which, as
already seen, large public expenditure was incurred;
and to this fact is owing, in the main, the rapid reduction
in typhoid mortality shown in the following statement:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
in 1911 was 13,852<br>
in 1917 was 4,601&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was, it will be noted, a period of apparent
cessation of decline in the typhoid mortality between
1891 and 1901, followed by a striking decline between
1901 and the present time. The late decline was due
in large measure to the discovery of the relation between
contaminated shell-fish and enteric fever, and,
probably to a less extent, to the realisation of the importance
of the small minority of cases of this disease,
who continue after their recovery to spread infection.
At the present time typhoid fever promises
to become as rare in England as typhus fever or malaria;
and with increased care in the protection of
food, as well as of water supplies, and with the universal
hospital treatment of the sick and observation
of their bacterial condition on discharge, this anticipation
bids fair to be realised.</p>


<h3><em>Typhus Fever</em></h3>

<p>The history of typhus is similar to that of typhoid
fever; and when Murchison in 1858 asserted its spontaneous
generation under conditions of overcrowding
and bad ventilation—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Its great predisposing cause is destitution; while the exciting

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">he was expressing the considered conclusion of his
period.</p>

<p>Typhus Fever was not differentiated from enteric
fever in the Registrar-General’s returns prior to 1869,
but the course of events in later periods can be seen
in the following statement:</p>

<p>The cases in recent years were nearly all traceable
to imported infection.</p>

<p>The main factors in the reduction of typhus fever
have been the immobilisation of infectious cases in
fever hospitals, the rigid cleansing and disinfection of
invaded households, and the surveillance of persons
who have been exposed to infection. The clearing of
insanitary courts, housing improvements, and the associated
increased cleanliness of the general population
have doubtless aided; and it is a suggestive fact that
although the virus of typhus is not yet determined, and
although it has only recently been shown that typhus
is a louse-spread disease, the point of extinction of the
disease under peace conditions has almost been reached
in countries having an efficient sanitary organization
and a cleanly people.</p>

<p>With the demonstration that typhoid fever was commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
water-borne, that the spread of typhus fever
could be controlled by sanitary surveillance and immobilisation
of infectious cases in hospital, and that
diarrhœal mortality could be reduced by increased
municipal and domestic cleanliness, much more rapid
improvement in national health occurred in the decennium
1871-1880 and in subsequent years.</p>

<p>The course of events for typhoid and typhus fever
has already been noted. Before describing further
the action taken by central and local public health authorities
and the other influences conducing to reform,
it is convenient to summarise at this point the</p>


<h3><em>General Results in the Saving of Life</em></h3>

<p>Although I do not dwell further on the influence of
increase of wages, of better and cheaper food, of sanitary
education of the people, of a steadily increasing
standard of cleanliness,—in person and in spitting
habits,—and of improving home conditions, it will not
be assumed they must be omitted in any considered
judgment as to the means by which the saving of life
shown by the following figures has been secured.</p>

<p>The expectation of life at birth (or mean after-lifetime)
in England and Wales in 1871-80 for males
was 41.4 years, for females 41.9 years. It steadily
improved decade by decade; based on the experience
of 1910-12 the male expectation of life had been prolonged
by 10.1 years, and the female by 10.8 years. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
very large proportion of the lives saved were lived in
the years of greatest value to the community. Comparing
1910-12 with 1871-80, the reduction of the
death-rate meant that <em>each year</em> 116,401 male and
118,554 female lives were saved, and the future lifetime
of these persons whose lives were prolonged,—assuming
a continuance of current experience,—would
give an annual gain of nearly ten millions of additional
years of life, of which over seventy per cent. would be
lived at ages 15 to 65.</p>

<p>Of the annual saving of 234,955 lives, 64 per cent.
was ascribable to reduced mortality from acute and
chronic infectious diseases; and of the mortality under
these headings nearly one-third was referable to respiratory
diseases, the same amount to tuberculosis,
one-seventh to scarlet fever, one-thirteenth to measles
and whooping cough, the same amount to typhus and
enteric fever, and one-sixteenth to diarrhœal diseases.</p>

<p>The gain of life may be further illustrated by the
following figures. During the 32 years, 1881 to 1912,
over seventeen millions deaths occurred in England
and Wales. Had the experience of 1871-80 continued
throughout the subsequent years, the number of deaths
would have been increased by close on four millions.</p>


<h3><em>Specific Causation of Disease</em></h3>

<p>The preceding review will have made it clear that in
the period of earlier slow sanitary reform, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
much invaluable work was being done, it was in some
measure a groping in the dark, a continuous search for
further light while pursuing (or at least advocating in
season and out of season) such cleansing and purification
of man’s surroundings as were evidently needed,
and such segregation of the infectious sick as could be
secured in the absence of complete information of the
cases of sickness. Happily in the case of Small Pox
there was an additional effective protection in vaccination.</p>

<p>With Pasteur’s discoveries was inaugurated a new
era in sanitation; the general microbial origin of infectious
diseases, inferred from his discoveries, leading to
the conclusion that the chief source of disease to
others is man himself, and that his surroundings in the
main cause disease insofar only as they become a vehicle
for conveying disease by direct inhalation of
infected dirt (Sax. <cite>drit</cite> = excrement), or by swallowing
specifically infected foods.</p>

<p>The importance of the sanitary engineer in securing
pure water supplies and satisfactory sewerage continues.
The sanitary inspector’s work in removing
nuisances and accumulations, any one of which might
be specifically contaminated,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in controlling overcrowding
and uncleanliness as well as in other respects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
remains indispensable. But the brunt of guidance in
the exact prevention of disease, especially of communicable
diseases, must necessarily now fall on</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">the epidemiologist,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">the vital statistician, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">the laboratory worker.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h3><em>Present Limitations of Epidemiology</em></h3>

<p>The epidemiologist must always remain the chief of
these three, suggesting and arranging the details appropriate
to each investigation, putting together the
facts supplied by the two other workers and drawing
legitimate conclusions. In conducting his inquiries and
in searching for further light on obscure points, he will
need to remember Simon’s remarks (Eighth Report of
the Privy Council):</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>In the category of time, far out of human reach, there are
circumstances which greatly influence contagion.... These
almost cosmic arisings are spreadings of disease or facts of
cosmo-chemical disturbance which no mere contagionism can
explain.</p>
</div>

<p>These words had special reference to cholera, and
although we still know little or nothing of the mysterious
influences which permit cholera when unimpeded
to undertake transmundane travels at irregular intervals
of time, we can claim with certainty that in any
country in which sanitary surveillance is well organised,
and the internal sanitation of the country is good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the spread of cholera need not be feared. Thanks to
the great discovery of Jenner and to the complete
organization of measures for isolation of the sick, and
for vaccination and surveillance of contacts, we can
make the same claim for smallpox, whenever this mysterious
disease begins its occasional world travels.</p>

<p>But we have to confess our continuing relative helplessness
in preventing the spread of measles, and of
acute catarrhs, among our endemic infections, and still
more of influenza when—as recently—it makes its
devastating swoop on the entire world, and secures a
larger number of victims than the World War itself.</p>

<p>We can recommend isolation of the sick, and personal
precautions in speaking and in coughing and sneezing,
and occasionally may score an isolated success; but we
are practically helpless against this enemy. Nor are
we better acquainted with the means for preventing
the spread of poliomyelitis; and we cannot claim that
any measure against the spread of cerebro-spinal fever
has had undoubted success, except only rapid amelioration
of the conditions of overcrowding under which it
especially occurs. These instances suffice to show that
in the region of respiratory infections,—with the one
notable exception of tuberculosis, which we can control,
whenever we are ready to take the necessary complete
measures—we have much to learn. In respect
of most diseases due to respiratory infection we are
groping in darkness nearly as dense as that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
beset Chadwick, Farr and Simon in their earlier work,
and with little hope of any campaign comparable with
that against dirt <em>en masse</em>, which was largely effective
in reducing the specific infections of cholera, dysentery,
and enteric fever, of typhus fever and even of
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The great public health requirements for the future
are the conquest over acute respiratory infections, including
not only affections of the lungs, but probably
also measles and whooping cough, cerebro-spinal fever
and poliomyelitis and their allies; and the prevention
of cancer. So while thankful for the discoveries
already made, and for the beneficent work already
accomplished, we must hope that the rapid increase
of Medical Research in England and here will in due
time enable us to extend the application of preventive
medicine to diseases so far uncontrollable.</p>


<h3><em>The Importance of Vital Statistics</em></h3>

<p>In England public health progress has been largely
actuated by records of mortality, which have served
to make the public realise the need for expenditure of
money on sanitary reform. Experience has shown, as
Dr. J. S. Fulton has expressed it, that</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">every wheel that turns in the service of public health must be
belted to the shaft of vital statistics.</p>
</div>

<p>Accurate and complete returns of deaths and their
causes are essential in investigating the local and occupational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
incidence of disease, and in comparing the
experience of different communities: and the various
weekly, quarterly, annual, and decennial reports issued
from the Registrar-General’s Department have rendered
invaluable service to the cause of public health.
“Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
you free.”</p>

<p>It was not the least of Chadwick’s services to the
State that he discovered William Farr, who was intrusted
with the compilation of, and comment on, our
early statistics from 1837 onwards. His reports, with
those of Simon, embody the history of sanitary progress
in England and the motives and arguments which
actuated it.</p>

<p>The registration of births similarly enabled comparison
of birth-rates to be made; also of maternal
mortality in child-bearing and of infant mortality in
different areas, and at different parts of the first year
of life; and these studies made by medical officers of
health and more exhaustively in the Medical Department
of the Local Government Board have had great
influence in determining the intensive work for improving
the conditions of childbearing and of infant
rearing, which in recent years has been accomplished.</p>

<p>As time went on it became clear that registration of
deaths gave a very imperfect view of the prevalence
of disease, and that so far as infectious diseases were
concerned, valuable time was lost when preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
action could only be taken after the patient’s death.
Death registration told of the total wrecks which had
occurred during the storm; it gave no information as
to early mishaps, enabling others to trim their vessels
and thus weather through. It gave a list of killed in
battle, not of the wounded also.</p>

<p>And so began gradually, in characteristic British
fashion, the notification of infectious cases, the list of
notifiable diseases being extended from time to time.</p>

<p>From 1911 onwards the Local Government Board
prepared a weekly statement of infectious cases notified
in each sanitary area which was distributed to
every medical officer of health. Similar returns of
exotic diseases of interest to port medical officers were
distributed; and the successive annual summaries prepared
in the Medical Department of the Local Government
Board showing the incidence of the chief epidemic
diseases in every area now constitute one of the
most valuable epidemiological records extant.</p>

<p>Collaterally with the notification of infectious diseases,
including tuberculosis, to the medical officer of
health, occurred the enforcement of notification of
various industrial diseases occurring in factories, such
as anthrax, lead and arsenic poisoning, to the Chief
Inspector of Factories, Home Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>


<h3><em>Conditions of Medical Practice Bearing on Public Health</em></h3>

<p>It cannot be claimed that notification of acute infectious
diseases, still less of tuberculosis, has been complete.
It is impossible to discuss the reasons for this
in the present address (see Lecture IX); but the present
conditions of medical practice are largely responsible
for the partial lack of success. Hasty conditions
of work, failure to employ laboratory means of diagnosis,
or to utilise available consultation facilities
(especially in tuberculosis), and lack of training of
medical practitioners in preventive medicine, are
among the obstacles to further control of disease.</p>

<p>There will not be complete success until means are
discovered for training and enlisting every medical
practitioner as a medical officer of health in the circle
of his private or public practice, and of securing his
services not only in the early and prompt detection of
disease, but also in the systematic supervision during
health of the families under his care, and in advising
them as to habits or methods of life which are inimical
to health.</p>


<h3><em>Poor Law v. Public Health</em></h3>

<p>An approximation to this ideal was in the minds of
the early sanitary reformers; and it was one of the
misfortunes associated with the deterrent policy of
poor-law administration in medical relief, that separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
between Poor Law and Public Health appeared to
offer the best prospect of sanitary progress.</p>

<p>Had Simon’s advice been followed, when the Local
Government Board was about to take over the public
health duties of the Privy Council, the poor-law organization
might, and probably would gradually, have
been permeated by public health activities, and thus
the sanitary welfare of the poorest class of the community
would have been more completely safeguarded
on its personal as well as on its environmental side.</p>

<p>In his Eleventh Report to the Privy Council (1868)
Simon recommended adherence to the intention of Mr.
Lowe’s Nuisance Bill of 1860, which would have identified
the health and destitution authorities. He deprecated
the institution of “a differently planned
organization for objects exclusively of health”; subject
to the conditions that public health should not be
subordinate to poor-law work and that there should
be power to combine districts for certain purposes,
and action through committees in sub-areas.</p>

<p>Had this course been pursued, and had the central
public health policy not been preponderantly non-medical
and poor-law in sentiment and tradition, more
rapid progress in public health would have been experienced.
The central evil was intensified, as is shown
in Simon’s <cite>Public Health Institutions</cite>, by regarding the
medical officer of the Local Government Board as
merely advisory, and by the retention and extension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
on a large scale of local inspection by lay officers of
the Central Board, for conditions which needed systematic
medical control.</p>

<p>The problem of the proper relation between destitution
and public health and between the authorities
dealing with these, runs right through our past history
of social progress, and it is not even yet satisfactorily
adjusted.</p>

<p>The gradually increasing dissatisfaction with Poor
Law administration led to the appointment of a Royal
Commission which after several years deliberation, in
1909 presented a Majority and a Minority Report.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction, which these reports justified,
may be said to have been inherent in the situation; for
the Poor Law organization was constantly attempting,—more
or less under the influence of the principle
of “deterrence,”—two incompatible tasks: to prevent
undue dependence upon parochial assistance and to
give to those needing them the medical and nursing
assistance which the principles of preventive medicine
require should be given unstintingly, and completely
freed from any deterrent element. Although in many
parochial areas admirable medical work was done, this
was the exception, not the rule; and public sentiment
rebelled against the giving or the receiving of medical
assistance to which was attached the “poor-law stigma.”
Both reports recommended the scrapping of the poor-law
machinery by abolishing the present Boards of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Guardians and the general mixed workhouse; and the
Minority Report went further, proposing to complete
the supersession of the poor-law by various preventive
authorities, which were already partially in operation.
Thus everything connected with the treatment of the
sick would be transferred to the Public Health Authorities,
the care of school children to Education Authorities,
of lunacy and the feeble-minded to already
existing Asylum Committees, and so on.</p>

<p>Behind these proposals lay the principle that <em>the
treatment and the prevention of disease cannot administratively
be separated without injuring the possibilities
of success of both</em>; and this is a principle which
happily is becoming more generally accepted.</p>

<p>Before the report of the Poor Law Commission was
issued, examples of the application of this axiom existed
in the isolation and treatment of patients with
acute infectious diseases; in the increasing provision
for the treatment of tuberculosis; in the extension of
provision for care of parturient women and for their
infants; and in the system of school medical inspection
followed to some extent by treatment.</p>

<p>It is convenient to add here, that under each of these
headings, great extensions have been made since 1911;
and an even more spectacular public provision of treatment,
as the best method of preventing further extension
of disease, is exemplified in the gratuitous and
confidential diagnosis by laboratory assistance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the treatment of venereal diseases now given in every
large town in the country, the Central Government
paying three fourths and the Local Authority one
fourth of its cost. In order further to secure the success
of this treatment,—which is provided for all
comers with no residential or financial conditions,—the
legislature has passed an enactment forbidding the
advertisement or offering for sale of any remedy for
these diseases, and forbidding their treatment except
by qualified medical practitioners.</p>

<p>It is one of the great misfortunes of more recent
Public Health administration that the Report of the
Royal Commission on the Poor Laws has not hitherto
been made the subject of legislation. It would not
have been an insuperable task to find a common measure
of agreement between the Majority and the Minority
Reports. Indeed an adjustment has recently
been made between these two reports, as the result of
the deliberations of a House of Commons Committee,
over which Sir Donald Maclean presided; and
it may be hoped that ere long this will mean the realisation
of a much belated reform of local administration.</p>

<p>This forms an indispensable step in the needed
further struggle against the problems of Destitution.
So much of destitution is due to sickness that the separation
of the two problems is inconsistent with success.
“One-third of all the paupers are sick, one-third children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and one-quarter either widows encumbered by
young families or certified lunatics.” There are economic
causes of poverty, apart from sickness, but it is
essential to remember that every disease which is controlled
frees the community not only from a measurable
amount of sickness, but from the amount of poverty
implied by this sickness.</p>

<p>Had the policy of transfer of the duties of Poor
Law authorities to the Councils of Counties and
County Boroughs recommended in 1909 by the Poor
Law Commission been adopted, these last named authorities
would already possess a medical service for
the poor employing some 4,000 doctors; they would be
in possession of the large infirmaries and other medical
institutions of the poor law, and given reforms and
readjustments of these which are urgently required,
and combination of the hospital arrangements of poor-law
and public health, would have a greatly improved
medical service freed from poor-law shackles and capable
of gradual extension as needs and policy indicate.
The fusion of these two services with the school medical
service would have been an easy further step;
and England would by this time have built up a National
Medical Service, for the very poor, for all purposes
of public health—including poor-law—administration,
and for children and their mothers in special
circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>


<h3><em>Insurance v. Public Health</em></h3>

<p>Political circumstances, into which it is unnecessary
to enter, led to the adoption of a course, which medically
ran directly athwart the course of needed reform.
The National (Health) Insurance Act, 1911, was
passed, giving sickness and invalidity benefits to those
employed persons below a certain income who could
contribute a weekly sum, which was considerably less
than half the estimated cost of the benefits to be received;
and an additional medical service, further
complicating the already existing medical services of
the poor law, public health, and educational authorities,
was set up.</p>

<p>The establishment of national insurance against sickness
and disablement in the United Kingdom exemplifies
the contagiousness, under modern conditions of
life, of a new course adopted in any country; and Bismarck’s
attempt to counteract socialism by insurance
has been responsible for international, state and official
experimentation in insurance which has not generally
been well advised, and which is associated in England
with extravagant cost of administration.</p>

<p>Insurance against sickness is a praiseworthy and
valuable provision against future contingencies; and
on its non-medical side free from drawbacks. Neither
on its medical nor on its non-medical side, however, is
it an alternative to prevention of disease; and the National
Insurance Act in England must be held in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
main to have delayed the public health reform which
would have been secured had equal effort been devoted
to it, and the money lavished on insurance given in the
form of central public health grants conditional on the
active coöperation of local authorities. True, the
English public have been educated to think in regard
to sickness in millions when previous provisions for
the treatment and prevention of sickness had been
thought of in thousands of pounds; and there has been
an extension of provision for the institutional treatment
of tuberculosis, which probably has been more
rapid than would otherwise have been made, in the
absence of the alternative grants named above. It
should be added that, owing to the natural insistence
of insured tuberculous patients on treatment in a sanatorium,
and to the desire of Local Insurance Committees
and their officers to satisfy insured persons,
sanatoria have often been filled with unsuitable patients,
sent there regardless of relative social and
public health needs. The Maternity Benefit (of a
sum of money on the birth of an infant to the wife
of an insured person or to an employed woman) similarly
is given unconditionally, and should be replaced
or supplemented by the provision of service needed at
this time (doctor or midwife, nurse, domestic assistance),
which would ensure the welfare of both mother
and infant.</p>

<p>Apart from other reforms the transfer of medical
provision, of provision for tuberculous patients, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
for parturient women to public health authorities is
urgently needed; and the service should be given according
to need irrespective of insurance. The valuable
fund for medical research has already been placed
under the Privy Council.</p>

<p>The absurdity of regarding insurance as anything
beyond a possibly useful handmaiden and auxiliary to
Public Health, when strict administrative arrangements
are made for this purpose, may be illustrated by
the question as to what would have been the result in
sanitary progress if Chadwick or Simon had persuaded
the government of their day to insure a favoured section
of the public against the risk of typhus or smallpox
or tuberculosis or even of non-infectious illness?</p>

<p>Under the National Insurance Act medical domiciliary
assistance,—but only to the extent which is
within the competence of a medical practitioner of
average ability,—is provided under contract for one-third
of the total population; and evidently this implies
an immense abstraction from ordinary private
medical practice. There is no provision, hitherto, for
consultant and expert facilities when required (except
for tuberculosis), for the nursing of patients, or for
institutional treatment of any disease, except tuberculosis;
and no funds are generally available for these
purposes except such as belong to the community at
large.</p>

<p>In view of the preceding facts and of other considerations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
which I have not mentioned, reconstruction
of the English Insurance scheme is obviously required.
The scheme cannot persist in its present form. The
already accomplished amalgamation of the Local Government
Board and National Insurance Commission,
should make radical changes easier; an equally important
step would be the transfer of the medical functions
of the Local Insurance Committees to Public
Health Authorities. The creation of these independent
committees was one of the greatest blunders of
the National Insurance Act, which was conceived ill-advisedly,
had too short a gestation, and suffered a
premature and forced delivery; and we may hope that
ere long, it may be replaced entirely, on its medical and
hygienic side, by a rapid extension of the medical activities
of the public health service which will conduce
to the welfare of the whole nation.</p>

<p>It is impossible to justify the continuance of state
subsidisation of benefits for a favoured portion of the
wage-earning classes, when poorer persons who do not
come within the category of employed persons or who
fall out of employment, and when clerks and others
on limited salaries who are unable to provide adequately
for sickness, are left unprovided for.</p>


<h3><em>A National Medical Service</em></h3>

<p>What is most urgently needed is a national medical
service which will give for all who cannot afford them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
hospital treatment and the services of consultants and
of scientific aids to diagnosis and treatment whenever
required; and which will provide nurses during illness
treated at home, when this is asked for by the doctor
in attendance.</p>

<p>Outside the operation of the National Insurance
Act, these services have been provided to a steadily
increasing extent, but in a characteristically British
fashion. They have grown largely under voluntary
management, and as exemplifications of Christian philanthropy;
though official has rapidly overtaken the
voluntary provision of hospitals and nursing, the two
working side by side, each in their respective spheres,
and on the whole with cordial coöperation. The extent
to which institutional treatment with its more
satisfactory arrangements is replacing the domiciliary
treatment of disease may be gathered from the following
striking facts:</p>

<p class="no-indent">In England and Wales</p>
<p class="lh">Of deaths from all causes, in 1881 = 1 in every 9</p>
<p class="lh">Of deaths from all causes, in 1910 = 1 in every 5</p>

<p class="no-indent">In London</p>

<p class="lh">Of deaths from all causes, in 1881 = 1 in every 5</p>
<p class="lh">Of deaths from all causes, in 1910 = 2 in every 5</p>
<p class="no-indent lh">occurred in public institutions.</p>

<p>The facts as to Pulmonary Tuberculosis are even
more significant:</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the year 1911</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p class="lh">in England and Wales 34% of male 22% of female</p>
<p class="lh">and in London 59% of male and 48% of female</p>

<p class="no-indent">deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis occurred in public
institutions; and as each of these patients spent on an
average several months in hospital, at the most infectious
stage of their illness, a material annual reduction
in the possibility of massive infection of relatives and
others has been secured.</p>


<h3><em>Hospitals Important Housing Auxiliaries</em></h3>

<p>This institutional treatment of the sick has been
one of the chief influences counteracting the pernicious
effects of industrialism and urbanization. It has
relieved housing difficulties at a time when insufficient
bedroom accommodation is most injurious; and it has
secured year by year for a steadily increasing proportion
of the total population the improvements of modern
surgery and medicine as practised in institutions,
which permit of the poor thus treated receiving more
satisfactory and more hopeful treatment than is obtainable
for a large proportion of other classes of
society.</p>

<p>My address is already too long. Other opportunities
will be taken of explaining the rapidly increasing
part which the State and Public Health Authorities
are taking in the hygiene and care of motherhood
and childhood and of school children; in the provision
of additional nursing services for the sick, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
rapid growth in numbers of public health nurses,
health visitors, school nurses, etc.; in special schemes
for the treatment of tuberculosis and of venereal diseases;
and the circumstances under which the Central
Government are to a rapidly increasing extent paying
half (or in certain instances three-fourths) of approved
local expenditure on the provision of hygienic,
nursing and medical services; and I do not therefore
dwell on these points further.</p>

<p>Nor need I comment here on the remarkable fact
that the British Government under present circumstances
have departed from the economic position that
houses built by local authorities must be able to be let
at a rental covering all outgoings.</p>

<p>In Lecture II I shall deal with problems of local
and central government, and with the training and
appointment of medical officers of health; but the
present review, if it omitted from consideration on the
one hand the value of specially trained whole-time
health officers, and on the other hand the health significance
of the general advance in the standard of
medical treatment, as factors of prime importance in
securing the already achieved improvement in human
life and health, would give a most imperfect picture
of the actual facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>


<h3><em>The need to avoid Complacency</em></h3>

<p>Such figures as I have given, showing saving and
prolongation of life during the last fifty years, are apt,
if left uncorrected, to create a complacent warmth
tending to public health inertia. It may conduce
further to this folding of the hands when I state that
Simon in his first report to the Local Government
Board expressed the opinion that the half million
deaths a year approximately which occurred in 1871
in England and Wales were a third (125,000) more
numerous than they would be if existing knowledge
of the chief causes of disease were reasonably well
applied throughout the country; and further that had
the mortality experience during 1911-15 held good for
1871, the deaths in that year would have been reduced
by 200,000 instead of by 125,000, the ideal then aimed
at by Simon.</p>

<p>But with increased knowledge we know that a larger
proportion of diseases are preventable than was formerly
supposed. It will be easy within the next ten
years to reduce the death-rate by one-third of its
present amount, given systematic and adequate action
on the part of Public Health Authorities and an
effective educational propaganda among the general
public. More important still, an even larger proportion
of mankind’s total illness can be avoided, and life
on a higher plane of health secured, as well as life
prolonged to its normal limit. The work carried out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
during the last ten years, sanitary, medical and hygienic,
in improving the prospects of healthy child-bearing
and of normal infancy and childhood constitute
the most important advance toward national physiological
life on a higher plane which has hitherto been
made.</p>

<p>Preventive medicine can never be satisfied until it
has approached Isaiah’s ideal (Isaiah, LXV, 20),
“There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor
an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child
shall die a hundred years old.”</p>

<p>The subject is too large to be treated adequately in
the course of an evening’s address; and to bring it
within manageable compass it is necessary for me to
select my material rigidly and, as far as I can, to present
this material in such a manner as will bring into
relief its salient and most instructive features.</p>

<p>The evolution of public health in England proceeded
by experimental steps, some mistaken and then retraced,
others mistaken and not retraced, but steps
oftenest in the direction of a complete service, which
is the goal of our work.</p>

<p>The evolution has been a gradual growth arising
out of realized needs, rather than a logical development
based on general principles; and as politicians
and legislators seldom take a wide outlook, or consider
a specific proposal in relation to what is already
being done, and to what is the desired goal, the English
experience is especially instructive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>


<h3><em>Town-living and Health Problems</em></h3>

<p>Public health work became an urgent necessity
when men began to huddle in towns; and with the
industrial revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries the need for remedial action became
acute. It is hard to realize that in the days of our
grandfathers, the home was in most instances the unit
of industry; and that in the eighteenth century communications
between districts and towns were not
more advanced than those of the ancient Egyptians.
When, however, vast urban aggregations of population
multiplied, travelling facilities rapidly increased,
and the results of crowding, of contaminated water
supplies, of intensive and widespread infection, were
seen in devastating endemic and epidemic diseases.
Poverty, squalor, dirt, and their consequences, were
rampant in the towns, where underpaid work-people
were exploited by masters, whose self-centred outlook
had some share of justification in the political economy
doctrines of the time, which regarded any interference
with “freedom of contract” as useless or even
pernicious.</p>

<p>What is public health work? It is best defined by
stating its object, which is to secure the maximum attainable
health of every member of the community, so
far as this can be secured by the authorities, local,
state, or federal, concerned in any part of government,
acting in coöperation with all voluntary agencies whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
work conduces to the same end. The connotation of
public health becomes wider year by year. It embraces
physiological as well as pathological life; being
as much concerned with improving the standard of
health of each person as with the prevention and cure
of disease. Hence the importance of the “concentration
on the mother and her child” (John Burns), to
secure for them by all practicable means the conditions
of complete health, which during the last twelve years
has been a vital part of our public health work, and
which is now being made to include not only all hygienic
and medical help that may be needed, but also
such domestic aid as may enable the mother to bring
her children into the world and to rear them under
advantageous conditions.</p>


<h3><em>Scope of Constructive Health Work</em></h3>

<p>Public health embraces some eugenic elements, and
may comprise more when eugenists have accumulated
adequate non-fallacious evidence on which to base
valid conclusions. Already partial steps are being
taken to secure the segregation and prevent the propagation
of the feeble-minded and the insane; and in
sorting out congenital infection from true heredity
action is being taken to avoid congenital syphilis and
to prevent the large number of still-births due to this
race poison.</p>

<p>Public health in the main is concerned primarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
with the environmental measures calculated to prevent
the attack of man by disease, whether pre-natal or
post-natal. These measures may be industrial, as in
the prevention of accidents, of dust, of noxious vapours;
or sanitary, as in the control of water supplies,
food, or milk, and in the removal of organic filth; or
may be the application of preventive medicine against
infectious and non-infectious diseases; or therapeutic,
consisting of the prompt and adequate treatment of
all illnesses and the curtailment of the incompetence
due to them; or educational, consisting, first in importance,
in the training of medical practitioners, of public
health officials, and nurses; and, next, in the education
of the general public and especially of the children
in our schools, in the science and practice of public
health.</p>

<p>Advances in public health in many directions can
only be secured by continued and extended medical
research, and public health, therefore, has a direct and
immediate interest in promoting and subsidizing such
research.</p>

<p>These being the objects of public health, how far
have we travelled toward securing the end in view?
I do not propose to myself the pleasant task of showing
to what extent the general death-rate has been
lowered, infant and child mortality greatly reduced,
the duration of life extended, how typhus and smallpox
have been almost eradicated, typhoid fever made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
a disappearing disease, and tuberculosis has become
the cause of only half its former death rate. When
inclined to indulge in such pleasant considerations, I
recall the statement I have made elsewhere that one-half
of the mortality and disablement still occurring
at ages below seventy can be obviated by the application
of medical knowledge already within our possession.</p>

<p>Let me attempt the more difficult task of outlining
the history of forms of administrative control of disease
since 1834.</p>


<h3><em>Reform in the Control of Poverty</em></h3>

<p>Poverty and disease work in a vicious circle in which
cause and effect often change places; but it is certain
that disease is one of the most fertile causes of poverty,
using the word poverty in the sense of privation
of one or other essential of physical well being.</p>

<p>For this reason, and because the half starved form
a constant social danger, poor-law administration long
antedated public health administration. There is not
time to follow the course of earlier poor-law administration,
with its many and grievous abuses. The
Poor-Law Amendment Act of 1834, gave the Central
Government control over the systems of local relief,
secured the combination of parishes into unions for
poor-law relief,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and forbade outdoor relief to able-bodied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
men. The creation of an organ of central control
has led to the subsequent course of aid to paupers
being determined in the main in London, action of
poor-law guardians being subject to supervision by
government inspectors, and to endorsement by the
Central Authority. At first, medical assistance under
the reformed Poor Law was made as deterrent as non-medical
relief; and although there has been much improvement,
chiefly on the institutional side, medical
treatment under the Poor Law has to some extent retained
this deterrent element, and it has, except in
the poor-law infirmaries of large cities, remained generally
disliked by the people concerned.</p>

<p>The first Central Poor-Law Authority was a Commission
having no representative in Parliament. In
1847 it was replaced by a Board, the president of which
was a member of Parliament and of the Government.
Here once for all Parliament declared its intention to
maintain direct control of central official government,
and in this and in all other departments has done so.
If democracy is to be real,—and we have no sound,
practicable alternative to it,—evidently the representatives
of the people must be masters of the administration;
and English policy has never wavered on this
point. After many years’ experience of public life in
England, I have no hesitation in saying that this principle
is sound; that it insures progress which, although
slow, is less liable to relapse than administration under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
autonomous expert commissions, whether centrally or
locally; and that any lack of progress that has been
experienced in central government has been as much
the result of inactivity and of lack of sympathy with
social reform on the part of the permanent officials of
government departments who have had access to their
parliamentary chief, as of the inertia of politicians or
their obstruction to reform.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with Poor-Law administration has
steadily increased in the years since 1834, as the problem
of the able-bodied pauper has diminished and the
Poor Law has been concerned more and more with the
sick and infirm, the aged, and children. These at the
present time form some 98 per cent. of the total population
relieved. The fundamental principles of the
Poor Law were rightly attacked. It did not comprise
elements tending to build up disabled families, or to
prevent families from falling hopelessly and permanently
into destitution. The law was administered
almost entirely with a view to <em>relief</em>; practically not
at all as a <em>curative</em> agency. In medical language,
symptomatic and not rational causal treatment was the
rule.</p>

<p>In medical relief, poor-law administration has been
a constant struggle between increasingly humane treatment
and the conception that the pauper’s position
must remain inferior to that of the non-pauper; an
important principle when applied to the able-bodied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
adult who has drifted into willing dependence; mischievous
when applied to sick persons, and to dependent
women and children.</p>

<p>The general dissatisfaction with poor-law administration
led to the appointment of a Royal Commission
on the Poor-Laws which, after several years’ deliberation,
published in 1909 a majority and a minority
report. Both these reports recommended the abolition
of boards of guardians, and the transfer of their
duties to the 144 largest public health authorities in
the country (County Councils, 44; and the Councils of
county boroughs, 82), and the abolition of the general
workhouse. The majority report would have continued
the Poor-Law Guardians as a Committee of the new
Authority; the minority report proposed to distribute
the duties of the guardians to different committees of
the Public Health Authority; thus medical treatment
to the Public Health Committee; the care of lunacy
and the feeble-minded to the Asylum Committee; care
of children to the Education Committee; vagrants,
etc., to the Police Committee; a special committee concerning
itself with all questions of monetary assistance.</p>

<p>A compromise between these two schemes has recently
been arranged, and when the new Ministry of
Health, which will combine public health, poor-law,
insurance, and educational medical work in one department,
has found time to do urgently needed work,
the above indicated reform may be hoped for, along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
with the even more urgently needed reform of local
public health administration, and the abolition of a
large number of the smaller and less efficient sanitary
authorities. With these reforms will come much
needed de-centralization of poor-law work. Good
work in all respects cannot be secured if the Central
Authority concerns itself, as at present, in minutiae of
local administration, and has no time to devote itself
to the larger problems, and to the task of bringing
indifferent, chiefly smaller authorities, up to the standard
of efficient local authorities. A large portion of
the expense of local poor-law administration is borne
by the central exchequer, and this money if properly
applied will give the necessary leverage for reform,
while leaving progressive Authorities, and especially
the Authorities of large towns, free to experiment and
advance.</p>


<h3><em>Reform in Industry</em></h3>

<p>The industrial revolution meant the subjection of
large masses of working class families to evil conditions
of housing and work in crowded and insanitary
dwellings and factories. The public conscience first
rebelled in regard to boarded out and apprentised
pauper children; and the first Factory Act in 1802 concerned
itself with them; and with this Act emerged
the germ of machinery for securing compliance with
the law, magistrates and clergymen being appointed
as inspectors under the Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>The Act was largely futile; but it meant the beginning
of the gradual breaking down of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</i>
doctrines; and there followed a more widely operative
Factory Act in 1833, restricting hours of labor of
children, and initiating professional inspectors controlled
and paid by the Government. In 1842 the
underground employment of women in mines was
forbidden; and at intervals since then numerous factory
and allied acts have been passed, restricting the
duration and conditions of work of women and children,
improving rules as to sanitation, insuring systematic
inspection by government inspectors, and constituting
a far reaching system of supervision and
control.</p>

<p>The inspectors, on whom falls the burden of ensuring
compliance with the Factory Laws and regulations
made under them, are controlled by the department of
the central government known as the Home Office;
their work on the whole has been well done, and the
conditions of factory and workshop life have greatly
improved. Some portion of the sanitary supervision
of these work-places falls on the local Sanitary Authority;
but in the main the system is one of absolutely
centralized government control. This secures almost
complete absence of improper influence of interested
local persons, whether masters or workmen; but it is
arguable that this system should be replaced by a localized
system, the inspectors being officers of the 144<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
larger authorities. These local officers could be placed
in direct touch with the Home Office or the Ministry of
Health and with the central staff of inspectors having
expert knowledge in the different branches of industrial
work.</p>


<h3><em>Public Health Reform</em></h3>

<p>Public health reform was a direct consequence of
the Poor-Law Amendment Act, 1834. Anxious to diminish
the enormous expense of the existing Poor
Law, and realizing that a large share of this sickness
was due to fever and other illnesses, surveys and inquiries
were set on foot by the commissioners administering
this Act, and the reports which followed revealed
a state of things urgently calling for sanitary
reform, in the interest of national economy as well as
of health. “An Act for Promoting the Public Health”
was passed in August, 1848, which created a General
Board of Health consisting of four members and a
secretary. These Commissioners, among whom was
Edwin Chadwick, former Secretary of the Poor Law
Board, initiated a system of procedure which was
largely on the lines of poor-law action, and which involved
constant pin-pricking by the Central Authority
of the grossly indifferent local authorities. The commissioners
were more zealous than discreet; and after
six years they were no longer tolerated. At that time
centralization was as much a bogie as socialism has
become in more recent years. Parliament and the localities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
represented by its members doubtless feared
the reforming activity of Chadwick and his colleagues,
though they sheltered themselves behind their exaggerated
fears of bureaucracy and centralization.</p>

<p>A new board replaced the old, parliamentary in character,
its president being a member of the Government.
This repeated, so far as concerns Parliamentary headship,
the story of the Poor-Law Board, and established
once more the theory of the administrative
control of the representatives of the people. Nor, although
the change meant for the time serious slackening
in sanitary reform, can objection be taken to it.
In a democratic government the elected representatives
of the people must take first place; and it is the rôle
of officials to educate them in the direction of needed
reforms. Reforms which do not carry public opinion
with them are not likely to be permanently successful;
and, whether in administration or in legislation, attempts
to sidetrack or ignore this fact are not likely
to be permanently effective.</p>


<h3><em>Public Health Reforms</em></h3>

<p>When the Local Government Board was formed in
1870, a second opportunity was lost of developing
Public Health Administration on lines which we now
know to be the best adapted for a complete service of
preventive medicine. The first lost opportunity was
when sanitary authorities, completely separate from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
poor-law authorities, were created for administering
the sanitary laws. Probably this arose from Chadwick’s
despair of getting effective sanitary reform
from poor-law guardians; but the creation of separate
authorities was scarcely consistent with the fact recognized
by him that pauperism is largely, if not predominantly
a question of sickness; or with the less
recognized fact that its treatment forms an essential
part of prevention. It was recognized that the care of
the sick was largely idle until the unnecessary causes
of disease had been cut off, but not that the adequate
treatment of sickness is an important means of preventing
it or of curtailing it. Rumsey,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in 1856, stated
the unrealized possibilities of the poor-law medical
officer’s domiciliary attendance on paupers in the following
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>There are much higher functions of a preventive nature
than those of a mere “public informer” which the district
medical officer ought to perform. He should become the sanitary
adviser of the poor in their dwellings ... he (should)
be in a peculiar sense, the missionary of health in his own
parish or district,—instructing the working classes in personal
and domestic hygiene,—and practically proving to the helpless
and debased, the disheartened and disaffected, that the State
cares for them, a fact of which, until of late, they have seen
but little evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>In the result the <em>ad hoc</em> poor-law authority did not
absorb into it the newly created municipal and urban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and rural sanitary administration, but continued on its
separate path.</p>

<p>Simon, in 1868, had urged the inadvisability of continuing
<em>ad hoc</em> authorities, and had urged that, at least,
sanitary should be made coterminous in area of administration
with poor-law districts. His advice was
not adopted, and there followed years in which sanitary
authorities were allowed to subdivide areas, until
the total number became 1,807 instead of 635, the
number of poor-law authorities; and in which they
concerned themselves chiefly with nuisances and water
supplies and with inadequate provision for the prevention
and treatment of infectious diseases. With the
creation of county councils and the more complete autonomy
of the councils of county boroughs, the large
centres of population developed and improved their
sanitary administration more rapidly; and it became
practicable to undertake every division of sanitary
work on an efficient scale. Although much remains
to be done, it can be claimed that in our larger towns,
containing more than half of the total population of
the country, the public health work in nearly all its
branches is of a high order. It would have been still
more efficient had the poor-law guardians been merged
in the Town Council, and had the relationship between
the school medical service and the other branches of the
public health service been closer than has been the case.</p>

<p>What is now needed is that the defects just named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
should be made good; that more complete autonomy
should be given to the authorities which come up to a
required standard, and that especially they should have
greater freedom in developing local possibilities of
improved administration. Central grants in aid of
local sanitary administration are steadily increasing.
Already the Government pays one-half of local expenditure
on a large program of maternity and child
welfare work, one-half of the expense of local tuberculosis
work, and three-fourths of the expense of local
work for the diagnosis and treatment of venereal diseases,
and for propaganda work concerning these.
These grants should be the means of greatly increasing
good local administration; but if,—this is improbable,—they
curtail local experimentation and extension,
and bring local public health administration into anything
approaching the subservience of local poor-law
administration, the value of these subventions will be
doubtful.</p>


<h3><em>Education Authorities and Health</em></h3>

<p>The national system of compulsory elementary education
inaugurated in 1870 has had valuable indirect
influence in promoting the public health. Apart from
the beneficent effect of education, the steadily increasing
pressure on children to come to school in a cleanly
condition and the stimulus of emulation in tidiness and
cleanliness, have done much to improve the home conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of the people. After the South African war
much attention was drawn to the large number of recruits
rejected owing to physical disabilities; and an
inter-departmental committee reported <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i> in
favour of a system of medical inspection of pupils in
elementary schools, which had often been urged by
hygienists. Observations made in Glasgow and Edinburgh
by Leslie Mackenzie did much to draw attention
to the physical defects in Scottish school children. In
1907 the Board of Education acquired power to make
provision through the local education authorities for
the medical inspection and treatment of school children.
At first little more than inspection of pupils
was undertaken, a large number of defects of sight,
hearing, parasitic conditions, as well as malnutrition
and actual disease being discovered. Gradually some
items of treatment were undertaken at school clinics,
or at hospitals or centres subsidized by the education
authorities; though the amount of treatment is still
small compared to the defects discovered and not
otherwise treated.</p>

<p>But there now existed in every locality three authorities
concerned in the treatment of disease:</p>

<p>1. Poor-law guardians, treating all forms of illness
in paupers, at home and in institutions.</p>

<p>2. Public health authorities, undertaking preventive
measures against disease, and treating fevers, tuberculosis,
and occasionally other diseases in institutions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and more recently providing nurses at home for certain
conditions.</p>

<p>3. Local education authorities, concerned in treating
certain ailments in school children.</p>

<p>Centrally two government departments were supervising
this work, and subsidizing it to some extent
from government funds; and poor-law medical work
and public health medical work were supervised by
two divisions of the Local Government Board acting
in almost complete isolation. More recently Parliament
has permitted the Board of Education to give
grants in aid of schools for mothers, and allied institutions
for the care of children under school age; for
which institutions, substantially, the Local Government
Board in other instances was giving grants.</p>

<p>The separation of the medical work of Education
Authorities from public health medical work was contrary
to the first principles of sound administration;
although it is possible that, owing to the inertia in some
public health circles, this separation at first favored
rapid advance in school hygiene; just as the early
development of public health apart from poor-law
administration was probably more rapid than could
have been expected from centrally ridden local authorities,
concerned chiefly in keeping down the poor rates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>


<h3><em>The Ad Hoc Vice</em></h3>

<p>But in both instances there was an offence against
the first principles of good administration, which require
that when a special function is to be undertaken
it shall be undertaken by one governing body for the
whole community needing the service, and not for different
sections of the community by several governing
bodies. Medical treatment is needed for school children
and for the poor generally. Why separate this
into two administrations? Hospitals are required for
paupers with tuberculosis, and for non-paupers with
tuberculosis. Why have two authorities for this
work? The separate existence of Education and
Poor-Law Authorities <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qûa</i> medical attendance on those
children needing it erred, not only in this fundamental
respect, but also because neither of these authorities
had the preventive facilities and powers possessed by
Public Health Authorities, who were also partially
engaged in the treatment of disease.</p>

<p>The inveterate tendency in the past has been to
create a new authority when any new work was inaugurated,
this authority then fulfilling all purposes
for a special portion of the community and thus necessarily
duplicating the staffs of other departments of
local or central government. The crowning instance
of this recurring instance of legislative myopia is seen
in the case of the National Insurance Act, under which
has been provided an imperfect and unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
domiciliary medical service for one-third of the entire
population of Great Britain, when by combining and
extending the medical forces of existing departments
of the state, a satisfactory service for all needing it
would have been secured. The axiom that “the object
of community service is to do away with group
competitions and bring in its place group coöperation
or team work” (Goodnow), is especially applicable
to all public health and medical work; and the spirit of
this axiom is infringed by the existence of separate,
sometimes competing, occasionally conflicting, services
under separate local and central control.</p>


<h3><em>Principles of Local Government</em></h3>

<p>The preceding considerations bear on the perennial
problem of efficient government, local and central.
There are three functions to be performed in government,
legislation, determination of administrative policy
and extent of work, and the actual executive work.
In England, legislation is in the hands of Parliament
and is usually national in scope. Large cities, however,
not infrequently obtain special legislative power
to meet local needs; and by this means have succeeded
in advancing local efficiency above the average standard.
Local authorities, furthermore, have the power
to make regulations and by-laws for special purposes,
subject to the approval of the Central Authority.</p>

<p>In settling the details of local administration, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
elected representatives of the public are supreme.
They meet in Council, and action is taken on a majority
vote. The councils of counties and cities, and even
of smaller municipal boroughs divide themselves into
committees, each consisting of about a dozen members,
elected by vote of the whole Council. The chairman
or mayor of the Council has no special power,
except that he may give a casting vote.</p>

<p>The chief defect in local sanitary administration in
England is the continued existence of a large number
of small and relatively inefficient local authorities.
The larger authorities, as a rule, do their work well,
and politics enter but little into elections. Official
posts are not vacated with changing councils. These
councils are approximating to the ideal of a complete
local Parliament dealing with all governmental concerns,
and to the further ideal that each unit of government
should be large enough to minimize the influence
of local interested motives, and to undertake each department
of municipal work on a considerable scale.
The local Parliament has committees concerned with
police, finance, public health, education; and when the
urgently needed poor-law reforms are made, and
when the Education Committee hands over its medical
work to the Public Health Committee, the ideal will
become a fact.</p>

<p>Power is already given to coopt on to some of these
committees a few persons who are not members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the Council, from among men or women having special
knowledge of the Committee’s work; and the exercise
of this power has been found to be useful.</p>

<p>But in each committee it is the direct representatives
of the public who decide points of policy and settle the
main outlines of administration. There is growing up
a tendency to appoint local advisory committees, consisting
of special groups representing professional or
trade interests. Thus a medical committee may be
consulted on medical proposals, and so on. This is
still in the experimental stage. It will probably prove
permanently useful, as voicing the occupational aspect
of any proposed work of the municipality; but it will
need to be kept to its strictly consultative limitations,
and the responsibility of the Council as representing
the combined wisdom or unwisdom of the entire community
must be maintained.</p>

<p>All substitutes for government of the people by the
representatives of the whole population are open to
objection. They do not contain within them the elements
of permanence. If there is a corrupt council,
the remedy is not its supersession by an independent
executive. Such an executive is the abrogation of
popular government. “Good and efficient government
is possible under almost any form of organization.
More depends upon men than devices.... But
... if we believe that the functions of deliberation
or determination of municipal policy and of administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
or the execution or carrying out of that policy
should be kept distinct, we cannot avoid the conclusion
that a city council is a necessary part of the municipal
organization.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Each committee of the local Council is advised by
the County Clerk or Town Clerk on legal and administrative
matters; and the medical officer of health and
other expert officers, like the legal adviser, in nearly
every instance, hold office during good behaviour.
Under the above arrangements the elected members
and the officials are kept in touch with each other.
The latter’s recommendations and actual work must
be approved by the former; and this works well under
the system of determination of policy by committees,
subject to confirmation and control by the entire Council.
The motive power is public opinion. Good work
cannot for any prolonged period go beyond what the
public demand, and the work of officials is one of constant
education of their masters and of the public.</p>


<h3><em>The Training and Tenure of Office of Health Officers</em></h3>

<p>Every sanitary district is required to appoint a medical
officer of health and since 1888 every medical
officer of health for a district with a population exceeding
50,000 must have a special diploma in public
health. The enforcement of this requirement has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
done much to raise the standard of work of these
officers. It is significant, furthermore, that while in
1873 the percentage of the total population of England
and Wales having whole-time medical officers of
health was only 20.6, it had increased to 61.4 per cent.
in 1911. In the metropolis, in the whole of Scotland,
in every English county (forty-four) and in many
other districts these officers possess security of tenure,
in the sense that they cannot be removed from office
without the consent of the Central Government, which
usually pays half their salaries. Even without this
safeguard, removal from office by the local authority
is rare; but there has been long delay in securing the
further reform that in all areas the medical officer of
health should be able to perform his difficult and sometimes
obnoxious duties without fear of removal from
office, or of reduction in his emolument, except as the
result of deliberate action on appeal to a central authority.</p>

<p>When pensions can be earned by medical officers
of health and by all medical men on the public health
staff, their position will become more attractive for
men of good standing; and this reform has become
more important in view of the steadily increasing complexity
of the medical work now undertaken in a large
public health department. It will include <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>
the following officers and activities: superintendent
medical officers of health; district medical officers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
health; tuberculosis officers; medical officers of maternity
and child welfare centres, of venereal disease
centres; fever hospitals, and tuberculosis sanatoriums
and hospitals.</p>

<p>The development of a graduated public health medical
service in which each physician employed will be
able to develop his own special abilities, will be easier
when to the above list is added the work of district
(late Poor-Law) medical officers; medical practitioners
attending insured persons and such other persons
as are treated at the expense of the State; treatment
centres for special conditions of the ear, eye, throat;
gynecological and other special departments; hospital
treatment for general diseases.</p>

<p>That there will be development in these directions
when the tangle caused by the National Insurance Act
of 1911 has been unravelled, there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>I have in Lecture IV expressed my opinion as to
the additional tangle introduced into the central and
local government of the United Kingdom by the National
Insurance Act of 1911.</p>

<p>The failure of the British Government to act on the
recommendations of the Poor-Law Commission of
1909 was a serious misfortune to public health. Sickness
is the cause of a predominant part of our total
destitution, and to allow the continued separation of
administrative action respecting these two problems is
inconsistent with a full measure of success. Political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
circumstances, however, led to the adoption of a course
which, medically, ran directly athwart the course of
needed reform.</p>


<h3><em>The National Insurance Act and Public Health</em></h3>

<p>The National Insurance Act was passed, placing
one-third of the total population (all employed manual
workers and other employed workers with an income
below £160, since increased to £250) under an obligation
to pay 4d weekly (women 3d), 3d being contributed
for each person by the employer and 2d by the
State. In return each worker receives a money payment
weekly during disability from illness, attendance
by a doctor, sanatorium treatment for tuberculosis, and
a maternity benefit on the birth of a child to his wife
(30 shillings), or, if the wife also is industrially employed,
an additional 30 shillings. The medical benefit
is limited to such domiciliary attendance as a medical
practitioner of average ability can furnish. It continues
the old popular conception of private medical
practice, and allows the public to remain obsessed with
the notion that satisfactory medical care consists in a
“visit and a bottle.” No provision is made for pathological
aids to diagnosis, beyond what is already provided
by public health authorities. No nurses are
available for serious cases; the insured person is not
entitled to surgical operations, when needed, except of
the simplest character. With few exceptions, no appliances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
are provided; the treatment of special diseases
of the eye, ear, nose and teeth is commonly excluded.
No hospital provision whatever, except for tuberculosis,
is made.</p>

<p>The contract system of medical practice has been
accompanied by a serious amount of lax certification
of sickness. The sanatorium benefit is unnecessary,
as soon as the duty of public authorities to provide
treatment for tuberculosis is declared obligatory. It
is already very largely provided. The maternity benefit
is entirely unconditional; there is no guarantee
that it is devoted to the welfare of the mother and
infant. It needs to be supplemented or replaced by
the arrangements for providing nurses, doctors, midwives,
and domestic assistance which are in process of
development by public health authorities. In short,
there is no justification for providing medical services,
preponderantly at the expense of the state (contributions
by employers are a form of taxation), which are
limited to a favored portion of the total population,
and which do not benefit all in need of these services.</p>


<h3><em>Provision for Sickness</em></h3>

<p>The principle of monetary insurance against sickness
and disability is thoroughly sound. It forms a
praiseworthy and valuable provision against future
contingencies. Insurance, however, is not synonymous
with prevention as is too often suggested. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
England insurance has been an actual impediment to
public health work, though it might have gradually
become a useful auxiliary to it if otherwise organized,
and especially if the creation of independent insurance
committees representing interests to a preponderant
extent had been avoided. But any medical service
needed for purposes of insurance should not form part
of the insurance system. Medical aid is needed for a
large section of the population who are unable to afford
deductions from their wages, or who have no
wages. It is needed for wives and children as much
as for the industrially employed head of the household;
and it is needed for many others who are excluded
from the scope of the National Insurance Act.
Only when the medical is separated from the insurance
service, and when the medical practitioner, as far as
practicable, is made independent of the patient who
desires too facile a sick-certificate, will good medical
work and sound sickness insurance be secured.</p>


<h3><em>General Summary</em></h3>

<p>The preceding review of the history of public health
in England is necessarily fragmentary. It does not
include, for instance, a discussion of the relationship
of the medical profession to public health authorities.
On this I content myself with repeating my oft stated
opinion that until every medical practitioner is trained
to investigate each case of illness from a preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
as well as from what is often rather a pharmaceutical
than a really curative standpoint, until a communal
system of consultant and hospital services independent
of any insurance system is made available for all
needing it, and until every medical practitioner is related
by financial and official ties to this communal
system, full control over disease,—to the extent of our
present available medical knowledge,—will not be
secured.</p>

<p>The communal system will include not only the provision
of domiciliary nurses for all needing them, but
also a greatly increased staff of public health nurses
engaged in educational supervision in connection with
the work of the communal services and of each individual
practitioner. Such a system will repay the
community manifold in improved health and in a
higher standard of happiness and well being.</p>

<p>If objection is taken to such wide sweeping proposals,
let me remind you that free communal services of
sanitation and education are already provided; and
that the care of personal health is of equal importance
with these. All will agree that a large proportion of
the population cannot afford to pay individually for
medical attendance and nursing under present conditions,
still less for the consultant and hospital services
which advances in medical service have rendered indispensable.
There is always present in our midst a
large mass of illness which might have been avoided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
or curtailed, had there been an organized system of
state medicine.</p>

<p>Lest there should be alarm as to the possible consequences
of the coöperative provision on such a scale
of this primary need of humanity, let me also remind
you that coöperative medical aid differs from financial
aid in an essential particular. It does not create a demand
for further aid, but is always engaged in diminishing
this demand. Dependency on financial
assistance is liable to continue indefinitely; much wants
more. This result of medical aid is almost inconceivable.
The Reverend Doctor Chalmers, of Glasgow,
said early in the last century: “Ostensible provision
for the relief of poverty creates more poverty. An
ostensible provision for the relief of disease does not
create more disease.”</p>

<p>Doctor Chalmers was opposed to the giving of any
domiciliary assistance from rates or taxes, and he
organized his parish so that every needy person was
adequately helped out of charitable funds. But he
advocated extended hospital and other medical assistance
for the poor; and until this is done, apart altogether
from any system of insurance, and as a complete
measure on the lines of our educational system,
we cannot say that all that is practicable has been done
to secure the physical well being of our fellow citizens.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">The Increasing Socialization of Medicine</span><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Medicine has always been the most altruistic of
learned professions; and can proudly claim that its
practitioners have ever been ready to give gratuitous
assistance to all in need of it. Even more than when
Burton wrote his Anatomy of Melancholy—for then
medicine was an art with but limited foundation in science—physicians
can be defined as “God’s intermediate
ministers”; and can rightly assume the proud
position which Burton gives them:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Next, therefore, to God, in all our extremities (<em>for of the
Most High cometh healing</em>, Eccles. XXXVIII, 2) we must
seek to, and rely upon, the Physician, who is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manus Dei</i>
(the Hand of God), said Hierophilus, and to whom He hath
given knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wondrous
works.</p>
</div>

<p>Each medical practitioner in his own circle, and to
the extent of his medical competence, is a medical officer
of health, having more influence in directing and
controlling the habits, occupation, the housing, the
social customs, the dietary and general mode of life of
the families to which he has access, than any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
person. It must be added that in most instances he
has even more influence than the minister of religion
in regulating the ethical conduct of his patients, especially
as regards alcoholism and sexual vices. In the
United States the federal government has relieved the
medical profession from their duty of restricting individual
alcoholic consumption, and an experiment has
been begun which if continued—and I trust nothing
will prevent this—must forthwith reduce the income of
practising physicians throughout the American continent,
and at the same time do more to diminish crime,
accidents and sickness and to increase national efficiency
than any other single step that could be taken,
with one exception. This would consist in the universal
raising of the standard of sexual conduct of
men to that which they expect from their future wives,
thus securing a rapid reduction and early disappearance
of gonorrhoea and syphilis, diseases which rank
with pneumonia, tuberculosis and cancer as chief
among the captains of death and disablement in our
midst.</p>

<p>The growing possibilities of improvement in personal
and social welfare depend very largely on the
extent to which, as I have put it elsewhere, “each
practitioner becomes a medical officer of health in the
range of his own practice.” Even on their present
record, if—at least on one side—the Kingdom of God
consists in “the union of all who love in the service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of all who suffer,” medical men can proudly and yet
humbly take their place as essential agents in the daily
fulfilment of the daily prayer, “Thy Kingdom come.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps desirable to attempt at this stage a definition
of the sense in which I employ the term socialization
of medicine. In it I would include the rendering
available for every member of the community,
irrespective of any necessary relation to the ordinary
conditions of individual payment, of all the potentialities
of preventive and curative medicine. Within the scope
of medicine are included the basic sciences of physiology
and pathology; and the instruction and training of
every child and young person in elementary hygiene,
including dietetics, necessarily come also within the
range of our subject.</p>

<p>There are still agnostics, usually of exclusively classical
and mathematical education, even among men
holding official sanitary administrative positions, who
doubt the value of the application of medical knowledge
to the extent indicated; and it becomes desirable,
therefore, briefly to refer to some results already
obtained by the application of preventive and curative
medicine.</p>


<h3><em>The Past Achievements of Medicine</em></h3>

<p>The increasing span of life is scarcely realized as it
should be. Addison’s description of the bridge of
human life, in his Vision of Mirza, is familiar. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
seventy to a hundred arches support a bridge which is
interrupted by broken arches and hidden pitfalls, set
very thick at the entrance of the bridge, thinner towards
its middle, but multiplied and laid close together
towards its further end. Preventive medicine is gradually
repairing the broken arches of earlier life; with
the prospect of rapid reduction of tuberculosis, of
syphilis and gonorrhoea, the removal of pitfalls and
the repair of both earlier and middle arches are ensured,
if the knowledge we already possess is applied;
and although pneumonia and cancer still erode and
render unsafe the arches of middle and later adult life,
we have already advanced far towards the ideal of
euthanasia in old age.</p>

<p>I may be excused from quoting English figures, as
our vital statistics are more accurate and complete
than those hitherto available for the United States.
Parenthetically, may I say that it is a continual source
of astonishment to me that in some American states
death statistics, and in many more states birth statistics
should still be so dubious in their quality as to cause
hesitation in utilizing them. And this in a country
which in other respects combines the highest business
qualities with an underlying idealism which emerges in
important crises!</p>

<p>Between 1871-80 and 1910-12 in England the average
expectation of life at birth for males increased
from 41.4 to 51.5, for females from 44.6 to 55.4,—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
increase within three or four decades of 10 or 11
years in average duration of life. The annual saving
of life shown by these figures means that the persons
whose lives <em>each year</em> are thus saved in England from
premature death, have the prospect of living in the
aggregate nearly ten million additional years of life,
of which the greater part will be lived during the
working period of life.</p>

<p>But perhaps more striking than collective statistics
are the illustrations of unnecessary premature mortality
with which history and literature in the Georgian
and Victorian period supply us. Many such instances
will occur to you. William Pitt died at the age of
47, Charles James Fox at 57. The history of the
Brontë family, given the clue that tuberculosis was at
work, can be seen on the tablet which I have often
read in Haworth Church. Each sister and the brother
died in steady succession at intervals of two and three
years; the only exception being Charlotte, who had
lived much away from home, and who died at the age
of 39 of unrestrained vomiting, a condition which
probably would not have been allowed to kill the expectant
mother today. Robert Burns died at the age
of 37, Keats at the age of 26. Lord Byron on his
thirty-third birthday, only three years before his death,
wrote as a man already “in the sere and yellow leaf”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Did time permit, the claims of preventive medicine
might be illustrated in the facts as to the almost complete
annihilation of typhus fever in this country and
in Great Britain, under the influence of hospital segregation
of each case, of supervision of contacts, and of
increased national cleanliness; in the rapid reduction
of enteric fever brought about by pure water and milk
supplies, the avoidance of sewage-contaminated shell-fish,
the control of carriers among food handlers, and
the hospital immobilization of cases; and in the almost
complete abolition of smallpox, secured by prompt
recognition, notification and isolation of each case, the
searching out and vaccination of all contacts, and their
continued surveillance. The list of medical triumphs,
especially in tropical diseases, might easily be extended.
I do not fail to remember that respiratory infections
have hitherto proved refractory to preventive measures;
and that common catarrh, pneumonia, and still
more influenza—as also cerebro-spinal fever and poliomyelitis—constitute
territories on which the flag of
public health has not yet been firmly placed. Tuberculosis
must not be thought of in the same category.
It is a controllable disease, so soon as physicians, public
health authorities and the patients themselves will
combine on an adequate scale to adopt measures
already within reach. These measures will be less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
costly than the present position of partial inertia;
health is always less costly than disease, and, as Dr.
Herman Biggs has often reminded us, can be purchased
within natural limits, to the extent which we
really desire. This is preëminently true for tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Medical triumphs have not been restricted to preventive
medicine. Time would fail me to speak of
the introduction of general anaesthetics by Morton
and Simpson, which has rendered possible the reaping
of the full harvest of the work of Pasteur and Lister.
Conversely modern surgery has itself abolished more
pain than anaesthetics themselves.</p>

<p>The chief triumphs of modern curative medicine
and surgery have been rendered practicable by the
more accurate study of disease and the more skilled
attention for the masses of the population obtainable
in hospitals. The steady advance in the provision of
skilled nursing has kept pace with medical advance.</p>


<h3><em>Increasing Importance of Hospitals</em></h3>

<p>From a return prepared by the Local Government
Board in 1915 it appears that the number of hospital
beds in England and Wales (not including lunatic asylums,
tuberculosis institutions, or convalescent or nursing
homes) was 4.9 per 1,000 of the population. In
the United States, according to the Modern Hospital
Year Book for 1919, the number of hospital beds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
amounts to 6 per 1,000 of the population, or 3.4 per
1,000, excluding beds for mental and nervous cases.
It is not certain that the two sets of figures are comparable;
but in both instances the distribution of hospital
provision is very unequal, and large tracts of
each country are left unprovided with available hospital
accommodation.</p>

<p>Hospital services have grown in a manner which is
characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon: first largely under
voluntary management, and as examples of Christian
charity; afterwards continued in the same way, but
followed by official provision of hospitals on an even
larger scale, the two systems working side by side.
The extent to which the more satisfactory institutional
treatment is replacing the domiciliary treatment of
disease may be gathered from the striking facts that
in England and Wales one in every nine of the deaths
from all causes in 1881 occurred in public institutions,
and in 1910, one in every five; while in London the
proportion increased from one in five in 1881 to two
in five in 1910.</p>

<p>The facts as to pulmonary tuberculosis are even
more significant. In the year 1911 in England and
Wales 34 per cent. of male and 22 per cent. of female
and in London 59 per cent. of male and 48 per cent.
of female deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis occurred
in public institutions. As each of the patients,
who thus had the solace of good nursing and treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
when they were needed most, spent on an average
several months in hospitals, at the most infectious
stage of their illness, an important annual reduction
in the possibility of massive infection of relatives and
others has also been secured.</p>


<h3><em>Hospitals as a Partial Solution of Housing Difficulties</em></h3>

<p>We may fairly claim that general and special hospitals
have been important agents, not only in reducing
the fatality of disease, and in restoring to efficiency
more rapidly than in the past a large proportion of
the total population; but also in reducing the incidence
of tuberculosis, of syphilis, and of other diseases.</p>

<p>The public indebtedness to hospitals has another
aspect, too often overlooked. The aggregation during
the last hundred years of a steadily increasing proportion
of our population in crowded towns has meant
the introduction on a gigantic scale of elements inimical
to health. Smoke and obscuration of sunlight,
dust and noise, the substitution of indoor for outdoor
occupations, the difficulties of milk supply for children,
and above all inferior housing with associated increased
facilities for infection, have combined to render
healthy life in towns difficult of attainment. Nor
must we omit from the adverse side of the balance
sheet the greater loneliness of family life in towns, the
diminution in neighbourliness, and the failure of public
social opinion to produce the wholesome effect on conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
which it exercises in village life. And yet, notwithstanding
these factors, urban death-rates and
especially tuberculosis death-rates have declined more
than rural death-rates, and in parts of some countries
urban is even lower than rural mortality.</p>

<p>Why is this? Our hospitals provide the key to the
mystery. Parturition is freer from risk in town than
in remote country districts; the means for the prevention
of infection are better organized, and accident and
disease are more promptly and more efficiently treated.
The poor in towns receive as a matter of course in
hospitals better treatment gratuitously than king or
president could command thirty years ago. The relief
to housing deficiency given by hospitals comes when
most needed, in the emergencies of child-bearing and
of sickness; and the net result of this and of better
sanitary supervision is that although room-accommodation
for families is much more restricted in towns
than in country districts, the town-dwellers have a
large share of their urban handicap removed by their
superiority over country people in medical treatment.</p>


<h3><em>The Continuing Mass of Preventible Disease</em></h3>

<p>The medical record of the past on the side of preventive
medicine is one of increasing control over infectious
diseases. In securing this result epidemiologists,
pathologists, and vital statisticians can rightly
claim first place, aided by the sanitary and industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
inspector and the sanitary engineer; the epidemiologist
being dependent largely on the work of the pathologist
and of the statistician for guidance in his field investigations,
which have led to the discovery and removal
of numerous sources and channels of infection.</p>

<p>The record in curative medicine, especially on its
surgical side, is one of increasing triumph over serious
disease and injury, in which the discovery of anaesthetics
and of Listerism have borne an essential part.</p>

<p>None of us can, however, be satisfied with the success
already obtained, and I have elsewhere given
reasons for concluding that at least one-half of the
mortality and disablement still occurring at ages below
70 can be obviated by the application of medical
knowledge already in our possession.</p>

<p>The Great War has shown both in Great Britain
and in America the extent to which defects and disease
exist in would-be recruits to our armies. In the
United Kingdom only two-fifths of a large section of
recruits could be placed in the first grade; and among
American recruits out of two and one-quarter million
men measured and examined physically at local boards
29.1 per cent. were rejected on physical grounds;
though in the introduction to the Official Bulletin (No.
11, March, 1919) it is pointed out that many of the
disabilities have little importance in civil life, and that
these considerations possibly “reduce to 15 per cent.
the proportion of males 20 to 30 years old who carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
a serious handicap against normal activity in civil
occupations.”</p>

<p>These figures, whatever doubt may attach to their
exact arithmetical value, signify the existence in the
community of a large amount of physical disability
which must greatly reduce the sum of national efficiency
and happiness. The records of our medical
examinations of school children bring out the same
fact, and emphasize the necessity not only for school
clinics on an immensely larger scale than at present,
but also for additional medical and nursing care in
connection with child-bearing and during the pre-school
period, which would discover defects and disease
at an earlier stage, and would secure the provision
not only of early preventive treatment, but also of
more systematic improvement of the sanitary environment
of maternity and childhood.</p>


<h3><em>Present Extent of Socialization of Medicine</em></h3>

<p>A mental effort is needed to realize the distance
traveled in the public provision of medical assistance
in the United Kingdom by the state and by voluntary
organizations, including the committees of hospitals,
convalescent homes, dispensaries, etc., prior to the
passing of the National Insurance Act of 1911. I
have already given some illustrative figures regarding
hospitals. The <cite>Lancet</cite> some years ago gave a statement
of the number of attendances of patients at voluntary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
hospitals in London during the year 1908.
Assuming that each out-patient made five attendances,
that all in-patients had previously been out-patients
and that no patient received a hospital or dispensary
letter more than once in the year, it could be inferred
that a number equivalent to one in four of the total
population of London had received free medical aid
in these voluntary institutions during that year. And
this did not include the large mass of treatment given
gratuitously in poor-law infirmaries, public-health fever
and tuberculosis hospitals, and lunatic asylums.</p>

<p>The majority of the medical profession in Great
Britain is engaged in either whole-time or part-time
service for the state or for local authorities. Of the
24,000 medical practitioners in England and Wales,
some 5,000 are engaged as poor-law doctors, some
4,000 or 5,000 in the public-health service, possibly
500 in the lunacy service, some 1,300 in the school
medical service, and smaller numbers in various other
forms of medical service for the state. This is exclusive
of the general practitioners who undertake
contract work under the National Insurance Act, and
who cannot fall far short of three-fourths of the total
membership of the profession. It should be noted
that many doctors hold several appointments.</p>

<p>The state has, quite apart from National Insurance,
given a rapidly increasing amount of medical assistance
to the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>1. Under the Poor Law, every destitute person is
entitled to gratuitous medical attendance, at home or
in an institution, and after a fashion has received this
during the last century.</p>

<p>2. The institutional treatment of lunacy has grown
to an extent which permits the treatment in an asylum
of every certified lunatic.</p>

<p>3. The treatment at the expense of the state of
feeble-minded persons is rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>4. Public health authorities provide institutional,
and to a limited extent domiciliary, treatment of infectious
diseases, this treatment being given, as in the
preceding cases, in nearly every instance gratuitously.</p>

<p>5. To some extent prior to, and to an increased
extent since, the passing of the National Insurance
Act, sanatoriums and hospitals for the treatment of
tuberculosis are provided by the public health authorities,
the central government contributing to the local
authority undertaking this duty one-half of all approved
expenditure on these institutions, on tuberculosis
clinics, and of the expenses incurred in the domiciliary
nursing and supervision of tuberculosis patients.</p>

<p>6. Similarly the central government pays one-half
of the approved expenditure incurred by local authorities
or in certain cases by voluntary agencies in assistance
given in aid of maternity and child welfare, e.g.,
in the provision of midwives, of consultant doctors,
of lying-in homes and hospitals, of beds for præpartum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
treatment, of convalescent homes for mothers or
their children, of infant consultations and clinics, etc.</p>

<p>7. In regard to venereal diseases the central government
has gone still further. It has made it obligatory
on the larger local authorities to provide facilities for
pathological diagnosis, and for the treatment of patients
suffering from these diseases irrespective of any
residential or financial limitations. Arseno-benzol
preparations are given gratuitously to medical practitioners,
as also laboratory assistance in diagnosis. To
ensure the success of the local arrangements the central
government pays three-fourths of their total cost;
and have passed an act which prohibits the treatment
of venereal diseases by any unqualified person, as also
the advertisement or sale of any remedies for these
diseases.</p>

<p>8. Many public health authorities provide gratuitous
assistance to medical practitioners in the bacteriological
diagnosis of tuberculosis, enteric fever, diphtheria,
etc. Recently Wasserman tests and searches
for gonococci and spirochaetes have been added. In
1914 plans for further development, including the provision
of complete clinical laboratories for the gratuitous
use of practitioners had been planned, and the
necessary grant had been obtained from Parliament;
but the war led to the plans remaining in abeyance.
At the same time government grants in aid of nursing,
and of the provision of consultants and referees for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
insured patients were passed, but were similarly held
in abeyance.</p>

<p>9. The local education authorities provide for the
medical inspection of each scholar in elementary day
schools several times during the nine years of his compulsory
attendance at school. Parents are advised as
to treatment needed, in suitable cases are referred to
hospitals (payment being made by the education authorities),
and for an increasing number of conditions
actual treatment is provided at school clinics (teeth,
eyes, ringworm, etc.).</p>

<p>The above enumeration, which does not include the
recently necessitated activities of the Pensions Department
for sailors and soldiers, and those under the National
Insurance Act, is not otherwise complete; but
it serves to indicate that the state is already committed
very deeply to provide for the medical needs of the
community. That the work done on behalf of the
community, <em>plus</em> the work accomplished by private
medical practitioners, is not equal to national needs is
obvious to any one considering the vast amount of
avoidable disease in our midst. Why is this and what
is the remedy? A partial answer is given by English
experience. The medical provision made in a large
proportion of cases is belated and inadequate; and in
perhaps a still larger proportion of cases medical advice
is not obtained, or being obtained, is not followed.
This applies even more to hygienic than to clinical
medical advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>


<h3><em>Destitution and Sickness</em></h3>

<p>It was one of the greatest misfortunes in the history
of medicine in England that poor law medicine and
public health medicine were not administratively combined
when the Local Government Board was formed
in 1870, and that the preventive ideals of public health
were not allowed to operate in the treatment and supervision
of the destitute. Although there has been
a fairly steady improvement in the conditions of medical
treatment under the poor law, its association with
the deterrent general policy of that department of
state, as well as its actual defects, culminated in the
appointment of a royal commission of inquiry, which
in 1909 presented reports recommending the abolition
of the local boards of guardians and transference of
their duties to the larger public health authorities.</p>

<p>Behind these proposals of the royal commission lay
the absolutely sound principle—which many years previously
had been recognized by the pioneers of public
health—that the treatment and the prevention of disease
cannot administratively be separated without injuring
the possibilities of success of both. The public
health activities preceding the report of the royal commission
illustrate this axiom, such as the isolation and
treatment of infectious cases, the treatment of tuberculosis,
the provision for the care of parturient women
and of their infants, and the medical inspection and
treatment of school children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>It was an even greater misfortune to the satisfactory
progress of public medicine that the report of the royal
commission on the poor laws was not followed by legislation
on the lines of its recommendations. So much
of destitution is associated with sickness, and sickness
is the cause of such a preponderant share of the total
destitution in our midst, that the continued administrative
separation of the two problems of poverty and
sickness is inconsistent with a full measure of success.</p>

<p>Had the transfer of the duties of the poor law authorities
to the councils of counties and county boroughs
been adopted, and ancillary legislation enacted,
the public health organization would have at once
possessed a medical service for the poor of some 4,000
doctors, in addition to the doctors already engaged in
the public health service; it would have had large infirmaries
and the other medical institutions of both
services; would have been able to make liaison working
arrangements with the committees of voluntary
hospitals; and there would have been secured a greatly
improved medical service, freed from poor-law
shackles, which could gradually be extended as needs
and policy indicated.</p>


<h3><em>Insurance versus Public Health</em></h3>

<p>Political circumstances led to the adoption of a
course which medically ran directly athwart the course
of needed reform. The National Insurance Act of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
1911 was passed, giving sickness and invalidity benefits
to all employed manual workers and to others below
an income limit of £160 (recently increased to £250),
who could contribute a weekly sum which was considerably
less than half of the estimated cost of the
benefits to be received; and a new medical service was
created, further complicating administratively the already
existing medical services of the poor law, public
health, and educational authorities, and converting the
majority of general practitioners into part-time civil
servants.</p>

<p>The case is an illustration of the moral contagiousness
under modern conditions of life, of a new course
adopted in any country. Bismarck’s attempt to counteract
socialism by insurance has been responsible for
state and official experimentation in insurance in
many countries, which at least in England was not
actuarially, financially, or medically sound, and which
has involved expenditure in administration entirely incommensurate
with the benefits received.</p>

<p>Insurance against sickness and disability is a praiseworthy
and valuable provision against future contingencies.
I am not concerned here to point out inequalities
to the insured in the English Insurance Act
inherent in the apportionment of a flat rate for all
ages, districts and occupations, and for both sexes,
irrespective of known or suspected incidence of sickness,
nor the difficulties created by continuing the nonlocalized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
work of friendly societies and other private
organizations, and at the same time creating local insurance
committees, who furthermore were not organically
related to local health authorities, and had no
opportunity, therefore, to develop the conceivable potentialities
of insurance experience as an aid to public
health work. The act in its present form is now generally
condemned; and it is significant that the need
for its radical reorganization appears to be universally
accepted.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Two medical benefits (medical and sanatorium) and
a maternity benefit were conferred under the act; but,
as they have been administered, it cannot be affirmed
that any marked public benefit has accrued; and it is
certain that if the same amount of money had been
placed in the hands of public health authorities to provide
adequate medical aid to those needing it, of the
kind most lacking and which they could least afford
to obtain, great benefit to the public health would have
been secured.</p>

<p>What was given? (1) There was the medical benefit,
each insured person being entitled to the services<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of a medical practitioner of his own choice (a “panel”
doctor). The services given were limited by regulation
to mean such medical attendance as is “within
the ordinary professional competence and skill” of a
medical practitioner; and so the treatment given has
often been more limited than what is given by the
more advanced poor law authorities. The latter can
supply hospital treatment and expert assistance when
required; under the insurance system no such provision
is made. The insured patient is not entitled
to surgical operations when needed, except of the simplest
character; treatment of eye, ear, nose and teeth
conditions is commonly excluded; no appliances are
given except a few bandages and simple splints; and
there are no facilities for modern scientific laboratory
investigation, except those provided gratuitously by
public health authorities. Furthermore, by the rules
of most friendly societies sickness (monetary) benefit
during treatment of illness due to the patient’s misconduct
is excluded.</p>

<p>The title of the act—National (Health) Insurance
Act—has hitherto proved a misnomer. The panel or
contract system of medical treatment of insured persons
has done much to continue the obsession of the
public with the conception of medical care as consisting
of a “visit and a bottle”; and so long as the
doctor’s medical work is on the present basis, and he
is under the constant temptation, not only to accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
more patients on his panel than he can satisfactorily
treat and to give each patient on application the mental
satisfaction of a “bottle,” but also to be more than
lenient in the giving of sickness certificates, it will
remain questionable whether on the balance state insurance
against sickness does more good than harm.
If medical consultants and referees, treatment centres,
and hospitals are in the future provided for insured
patients, this will mitigate the evils of the panel system;
but the present contributions of patients will not
purchase this additional provision. All the new money
needed, and most of the money needed under present
conditions, must continue to be provided by the state
and employers of the insured (a form of taxation);
and provisions thus made, like the present contributions
of the state for insured persons, are in direct
contravention of the general principle that government
grants being derived from the whole community,
should enure to the benefit of the whole community
in need of them, and not only to the benefit of a section
of it.</p>

<p>About one-third of the total population of Great
Britain is included within the terms of the National
Insurance Act. If the wives and children of insured
men were also included, as has been proposed, over
two-thirds of the total population would be embraced
in the scheme; but as persons manually employed, but
working for themselves—e.g., cotters and hawkers, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
encluded, and as persons not manually employed cannot
be insured unless their income is below £160 (recently
raised to £250), large classes of the population
who can ill-afford to pay for their own medical attendance
are excluded from the operation of the act,
and taxed to pay the benefits of insured persons.</p>

<p>(2) The sanatorium benefit was intended to secure
for the insured person special treatment for tuberculosis,
while capital sums were provided for the erection
of sanatoria and hospitals for consumptives for
insured and non-insured alike. Fortunately during the
passage of the bill, the provision of these institutions
for insured persons was delegated to public health
authorities; and as it was already within the power
of these authorities to provide such institutions and
tuberculosis clinics for the entire population, and as
the infection of tuberculosis is no respecter of parliamentary
distinctions between insured and non-insured,
there was little difficulty in persuading the government
to promise half the total approved local expenditure
on the treatment of tuberculosis in institutions, whether
this was given to insured or non-insured persons. Indeed
when local authorities were willing to undertake
their share in a complete scheme for the treatment of
tuberculosis an insured consumptive person might be
regarded even as paying fractionally for his treatment
while a non-insured person received such treatment
gratuitously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>(3) The maternity benefit, conferring thirty shillings
on the wife of an insured person, and an additional
thirty shillings if she also is an employed person
within the meaning of the act, on the birth of her infant,
was perhaps the most popular benefit under the
act. The money was given unconditionally, and thus
an opportunity was lost of insuring that the benefit
should improve maternal and infantile prospects.</p>

<p>Collaterally public health authorities, central and
local, were beginning to organize medical and nursing
assistance during pregnancy, in confinement and afterwards
for the mother, and similar assistance on a large
scale for infants and children under five years of age.
And there will, I think, be no hesitation in agreeing
that the <em>supply of service</em> at this critical period of the
mother’s and infant’s life, so as to insure the most
satisfactory recovery of parent and the best start in
infantile life, is infinitely more important than a money
grant.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to have more than touched on the
fringe of the complicated subject of insurance in relation
to public health. The inauguration of the act
meant an enormous increase in the direct relationship
of the medical profession to the state. A great stride
in the socialization of medicine was taken. But it was
done ill-advisedly; it continued a false and low ideal
of isolated general medical practice; it has even been
described as a fraud on the insured, in view of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
incompleteness of the medical service provided; and
it diverted into an unsatisfactory channel the energy
and money which were urgently needed for the immense
good obtainable by reform of poor law and
public health administration, and extension of their
medical services. Had the lines indicated by history
and experience and by the report of a strong royal
commission on the poor law—there was a majority
and a minority report, but both agreed in the chief
essential points—been followed, England would now
possess a nearly completely unified state medical service,
instead of standing at the point whence false steps
need to be retraced, with a view to a coördinated and
simplified medical and public health policy. With the
principle of contributory insurance to secure monetary
support during illness there can be no quarrel; but in
the interest of national efficiency complete medical provision,
preventive and curative, must be made by the
state, irrespective of insurance, for all in need of it;
and the medical practitioners employed in the necessary
certification of such insurance work as is continued
must, if the insurance is to be satisfactory, be
employed under conditions which will render them
independent of the favor of the insured, and will enable
them to utilize their knowledge of each patient’s
case for the needed preventive measures, whether
these be concerned with the sanitation of home or factory
or workplace, or with personal habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>


<h3><em>The Need of the Future</em></h3>

<p>It is, I think, clear that the state will year by year
take an increasing hand in medical matters. It is useless,
even if it were desired, to attempt to oppose the
inevitable and the eminently desirable trend towards
vastly increased utilization by the state of medical science
in the interests of humanity. It is for physicians
to guide the course of events, and to insure that no
plant is sown which will afterwards need to be uprooted;
that no development is permitted which will
hinder the fulfillment of our ideal. Personal hygiene
forms a rapidly increasing part of public health work;
hence it is indispensable that all forms of public medical
service shall be linked up with the public health
service and controlled locally and centrally in accordance
with this. This may imply—and in England it
does imply—the urgent need for reform and reconstruction
of local as well of central public health administration;
but to attempt to separate medical from
public health provision is to repeat the blunders which,
despite skilled advice to the contrary, have been made
on two great historic occasions.</p>

<p>A complete service, adequate to the needs of the
community, cannot be secured by a session’s legislation.
It must grow as the result of steady advance.
The motto in growth might well be, “First things
first.” What are the medical services which are provided
too sparsely at the present time and for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
the masses of the population cannot afford individually
to pay, except possibly to a fractional extent? There
can be no doubt as to the answer. What is most
urgently needed is the provision of skilled hospital
attendance for every patient who can be more satisfactorily
treated in hospital than at home. Next to this
comes the provision of gratuitous medical services—(e.g.,
maternity and infant consultations, eye, throat,
ear, skin and venereal diseases, tuberculosis, X-ray departments)
preferably linked around a hospital, where
patients can be sent by private practitioners for an
expert opinion, or in certain cases may present themselves
independently. And as important as either of
the preceding desiderata, is the provision of a complete
nursing service, on which each private practitioner
can call for assistance as required, payment, if
any is exacted, being on the easiest possible conditions,
and not made compulsory.</p>

<p>The hospital under such circumstances would become
a centre from which community work of the
highest value would radiate; and patients, private
practitioners, and the staffs of hospitals would alike
live in a new world in which the interest and efficiency
of medical work would be greatly increased. The
present irregular localization of hospitals makes the
realization of such a scheme difficult; but local partially
successful schemes are already in operation;
difficulties can be overcome with good-will; and eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
we may hope to have for each unit of subdivided
public health administration and as an organic
part of this, a hospital, with out-patient or dispensary
clinics, and radiating from these the various forms of
medical attendance, domiciliary nursing, public health
nursing, and sanitary supervision which are needed.</p>

<p>In securing such a result there will be needed medical
practitioners who are imbued with the ideals of
preventive medicine in its widest sense. Let me, in
this connection quote the following extract from a
recent official report of my own:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>There is needed a reconstruction of the training of each
medical student, which will make preventive medicine in its
widest sense an integral part of his training, and will insure
that before he begins practice he has definite instruction in
the application of the whole of his knowledge to preventive
purposes. The past conception by the public of the relation
of medical men to the community—apart from the special case
of medical officers of health—has been mistaken. The doctor
has been regarded as a help when serious or acute incapacitating
illness occurs, and he has but seldom had the opportunity
of giving advice in the earlier and more controllable
stages of illness. His training has been conducted on the
assumption that his chief rôle should be on present lines,
with the result that most medical practitioners enter into practice
with a too scanty knowledge of hygiene and preventive
medicine, and have to learn slowly in belated experience the
influence of environment on the health of their patients. The
teaching of medicine should be much more largely physiological
and hygienic than at present, and such subjects as food
values, the hygiene of infancy and childbirth, the physiology
of breast feeding, and the influence of environment on the
health of their future patients should be the subject of careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
training—especially in regard to housing, feeding, clothing,
and conditions of work. Were this done, the ideal condition,
in which each medical practitioner becomes a medical officer
of health in the range of his own practice, would approach
realization.—[Annual Report to the Local Government Board,
1917-18.]</p>
</div>

<p>Many medical practitioners already fulfill this ideal.
It would oftener be realized were it not for the excessive
work which many are obliged to undertake.
In the early history of public health in England poor
law medical officers, attending the impoverished in
their dwellings and familiar with their home conditions,
became part-time medical officers of health.
But the attempt to combine prevention and treatment
proved unsuccessful, because these officers visited only
a small proportion of the dwellings of the poor, because
they were not trained in preventive work, and
because the good seed of preventive work was choked
by the increasing demands of lucrative private practice.
In connection with the future general medical
service, curative as well as preventive, it is not beyond
the range of human ingenuity to provide schemes for
district medical officers (health and clinical) adequately
trained in public health work, and linked up closely
with the hospital and dispensary unit for their area.</p>

<p>This will cost money. But sound health is our
greatest personal and national asset, and disease is
always more expensive than health. “Who winds up
days with toil, and nights with sleep” has “the forehand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
and vantage of the king,” if the latter suffers in
body or mind. The real wealth of a nation does not
consist in its money, in the volume of its trade, or in
the extent of its dominion. These are only valuable
insofar as they help to maintain a population—and not
only a portion of it—of the right quality; men, women
and children possessing bodily vigor, alert mind, firm
character, courage and self-control. This ideal can
never be realized unless and until the medical men of
the future train themselves for and devote themselves
to their essential share in its fulfillment, and while
keeping this ideal in view see to it that every step
taken is one which will be consistent with the complete
scheme of the future.</p>

<p>We are all concerned in the efficiency of every member
of the community, from an economic as well as
from a humanitarian standpoint. Can we be satisfied
while a large proportion of the population do not
obtain medical and ancillary assistance to the extent of
their needs? Does such a state of things conduce to
the settlement of social unrest? Is it consistent with
Christian principles?</p>

<p>If communal provision has been recognized as a
duty for police protection, for sanitation, for elementary
education, should it not likewise be admitted for
the more subtle and maleficent enemies of health
which have been recognized, but which in no community
have hitherto been completely combatted?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>We scarcely realize how far we have gone in the
socialization of medicine. It is impossible to go back,
or to stand still. The services of the medical profession
are needed, not only to provide the necessary
service, but in helping to determine its conditions.
One essential item will be the substitution for fees
during sickness of an annual payment to private practitioners
by each family for supervising its members
in health, for inquiry into their industrial and domestic
life, so far as it contains elements inimical to health,
and for giving preventive more than curative advice.
The second and most urgent element consists in the
organization of hospital and consultative expert services
for all, which, while greatly increasing each patient’s
prospect of prompt recovery, will enable the
general practitioner to escape from the soul-destroying
inefficiency of unaided medical practice.</p>

<p>Of course, any service provided, whether partial or
complete, will need to be kept free from “political
pull.” This spells inefficiency; and inefficiency means
disease and death. “Political pull,” although not in
the official list of Causes of Death, is among the potent
causes of excessive mortality; and for this, every one
of us must bear his individual share of responsibility,
insofar as we have abstained from active support of
sound and clean government, when we were unable
to take an actual share in government.</p>

disease can be dealt with effectually by giving bottles of medicine
or liniment to the sick, or that if this fails and the sick
get worse, they can be sent to one of the overcrowded voluntary
hospitals with which the legislature has nothing whatever
to do. Anything more unsatisfactory to the sick, or demoralizing
to us as a profession, it is hard to imagine.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to advocate an urgent need of the profession,
viz: the establishment of an adequate number of auxiliary
hospitals throughout the country, staffed by teams
of general practitioners, to which all practitioners can have
access, and to which they can send cases requiring clinical
observation of any kind, rest or treatment that cannot be
carried out in the sick person’s home. (<cite>British Medical Journal</cite>,
July 19, 19.)</p>

<p>Dr. Howarth, Medical Officer of Health of the City of
London, and Dr. B. A. Richmond, Secretary of the London
Panel Committee, affirm “the limitation of medical benefit
to insured persons alone cannot continue. Another service
has been added to the many competing classes of state treatment”;
and they bring out the fact that personal contributions
of insured persons are swallowed up in supplying the sickness
and disablement benefit, and contribute nothing to the cost of
the sanatorium benefit, maternity benefit, or medical benefit.</p>

<p>Dr. H. S. Beadles, Secretary of the Stratford &amp; West Ham
Panel Committee, says: “The British Medical Association
should fearlessly acknowledge that the attendance under the
National Insurance Act, which is itself a part-time State
service, is an absolute failure and amounts to little more than
first aid, carried on at an enormous cost.”</p>

<p>So far as a majority of the population are concerned,
it is necessary to realize that they are never far removed
from the line dividing destitution from adequacy,
using the word destitution to mean insufficiency
or lack of some provision essential for health and continued
welfare.</p>

<p>It may be urged that this is owing in large measure
to the improvidence or thriftlessness of the wage-earners
who are chiefly concerned; but such a statement
fails to appreciate the higher standard of conduct
and the greater self-denial which is demanded from
weekly wage-earners than from ourselves, if out of
their wages provision is to be made for a “rainy day,”
without affecting unfavourably the present health of
the worker or his family.</p>

<p>The general appreciation of the above considerations
has led to the provision of non-contributory old-age
pensions in the United Kingdom; and similar sentiments
have led in many countries to compensation
for accidents at the expense of employers; and to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
various national systems of insurance against sickness.
With the principle of sickness insurance there can be
no quarrel. It is the substitution of coöperative for
individual provision, thereby distributing some of the
loss and eliminating some of the risk of suffering from
illness.</p>

<p>The value of any system of sickness insurance, however,
must necessarily be judged by several criteria.</p>


<h3><em>Criteria of Value of Insurance</em></h3>

<p>Is the adopted system one which is equitable in its
incidence and economical in its administration; and
does it supply maintenance during sickness adequate
for the needs of the patient and his family, while at
the same time offering no temptation to the patient to
continue on the sick funds, when his condition no
longer necessitates this?</p>

<p>In the case of the English National Insurance Act,
these questions unfortunately cannot be answered completely
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The finance of the Act arranges for the uniform
contributions (differing for each sex) from some thirteen
million persons, living under most diverse conditions,
to furnish equal benefits (differing for each sex)
to all insured persons, irrespective of age, locality, or
occupations; while at the same time some 23,000 independent
insurance societies continue to administer the
distribution of money benefits, each with its own segregated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
experience, some prosperous, others owing to
excessive sickness almost bankrupt. There is the remote
possibility for each society to pay additional
benefits if justified on the quinquennial valuation.</p>

<p>Substantially men and women have been placed on
a similar financial basis. The sickness of pregnancy
apparently was overlooked; and for this and other
reasons the insurance funds for women are financially
inadequate for the benefits promised.</p>

<p>On the point of equity, it must be admitted that any
system of so-called insurance which, like that of the
English Act, excludes a large proportion of the population
who, while paying in taxes in aid of the insured,
require but do not receive their benefits, is contrary
to the principle that any expenditure of Government
funds should enure to the whole community in need
of the provision in question.</p>

<p>The provision of 10 shillings a week for incapacity
lasting 26 weeks (7s. 6d for women), followed by 5s.
a week disablement benefit, although inadequate provision
for family maintenance during sickness undoubtedly
is helpful. It is mischievous when in consequence
of this provision, the patient is tempted to
remain at home under unsatisfactory domiciliary
treatment, instead of receiving the shorter and more
successful institutional treatment, which should have
been given.</p>

<p>As to economy of administration, I can speak only
with reserve; but it requires little imagination to appreciate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
that the numerous migrations of wage-earners
imply great difficulties in book-keeping as well
as in securing insurance medical attendance, and that
a very high percentage of the total insurance funds is
swallowed up in elaborate and meticulous account
keeping.</p>

<p>The point as to malingering can best be considered
in connection with a discussion of the</p>


<h3><em>Medical Benefit</em></h3>

<p>This consists of such medical treatment, at home or
at the office of the panel doctor,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as “can consistently
with the best interests of the patient be properly undertaken
by a practitioner of ordinary professional
competence and skill.”</p>

<p>The Act itself promised “adequate medical attendance
and treatment,” but under regulations this has
been limited, so that in practice it means chiefly the
treatment only of minor ailments. Thus (<em>a</em>) there
is no provision for hospital treatment of patients
needing this, except the Sanatorium provision for tuberculosis;
(<em>b</em>) with the same exception, there is no
provision for expert services. A patient requiring
operative treatment for fractures, for an amputation, or
an operation for appendicitis, or needing treatment for
some affection of the eyes, or nose, or throat, or ears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
or the intravenous treatment of syphilis is excluded
from medical benefit. So likewise are dental requirements.
(<em>c</em>) There is no provision for pathological
diagnosis, except such as is common to the entire
population, and no X-ray diagnosis, except possibly
for tuberculosis. (<em>d</em>) There is no provision for nursing
assistance.</p>

<p>In view of the unequal distribution and insufficient
provision of hospitals for the general population, of
their inaccessibility to large masses of patients, and of
the insufficiency of the present provision for the scientific
aid to treatment which modern medicine demands
for insured and non-insured alike, it is evident that the
provision for medical treatment under the Act is unsatisfactory
and inadequate, and that it conduces to
prolonged illness, which treatment provided on more
satisfactory lines would avoid.</p>

<p>To state adequately the defects of the medical provisions
of the Insurance Act a long address would be
required. They are, however, generally well known,
and their existence and seriousness is admitted by all.
(See also page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.)</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to say more on the</p>


<h3><em>General Practitioner Treatment</em></h3>

<p>provided under the Act. Every insured person is allowed
to choose his own doctor within a given distance.
In practice very few patients change their doctor at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
fixed time each year as they are allowed to do; and a
considerable proportion of insured persons do not
trouble to choose a doctor at all. The free choice of
doctors is rather a sentimental than a real demand.
The panel doctor is paid an annual capitation fee, and
hitherto no limit has been placed on the number who
may place themselves on his roll. The domiciliary
treatment given by some doctors is entirely satisfactory
within the limits stated above. Commonly, however,
it is as unsatisfactory as the “club practice”
which preceded it, and against which the British Medical
Association inveighed. It involves a continuance
of the mischievous ideal of medical practice of the
past, a conception still held by a large portion of the
public to its own detriment, that a hasty inquiry, a
perfunctory examination, and a bottle of medicine,
represent the best that scientific medicine can offer a
patient. Had there been organized a chain of medical
services for all needing it, including consultations and
expert assistance when needed, every patient having
the right to call for these when dissatisfied with his
panel doctor, including also hospital provision and
nursing as required, what a different story could now
be told!</p>

<p>It is probable that some at least of these additional
services will be added gradually; but it must be noted
that the present payments of the insured will not
suffice to pay for them; and that if they are to be provided,—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
they will probably need to be,—out of
public funds, the general public are in equity entitled
to these services even though they are not insured.</p>

<p>If these complete services were provided, the medical
treatment now provided largely at the expense of
the community could be made a means for advancing
the public health. This it can not at present claim to
be. For nothing is more certain than that the prompt
and adequate treatment of disease curtails its duration,
diminishes its severity, and prevents its spread
to others.</p>

<p>But even such a service would not fulfil its complete
possibilities for good unless it were joined to a system
of hygienic supervision of each insured person and of
each insured person’s family, this system being organically
linked up with the wider public health work of
the larger Public Health Authorities.</p>

<p>The chief justification of a national system of insurance
against sickness is that it shall be an active auxiliary
in the prevention of disease. At present it is
doubtful whether any national system of sickness insurance
has been so. It has only been so, to the extent
to which the medical treatment of the masses of the
population has been improved by it; and no such improvement
can be claimed for British insurance. The
wider possibilities of prevention of illness and elevation
of the general standard of health, by making each
medical practitioner a family adviser on health more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
than a practitioner in medicine, have not been realised
or even brought within sight.</p>


<h3><em>Evils of the Present Medical Benefit</em></h3>

<p>The inadequacy and unscientific character of the
medical treatment given to insured persons are associated
with a large amount of lax certification of illness,
which is injurious to the character of doctor and
patient, besides being unfair to the insurance funds.
Those interested in this point should read paragraphs
118, 119, 120, 121, 123, 125 of the Report of the Departmental
Committee on Sickness Benefit Claims
(Official Report Cd 7687).</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>There is almost universal testimony of the belief (of representatives
of friendly societies) that medical certificates are
granted recklessly (par. 119).</p>

<p>Doctors ... feel a difficulty in refusing certificates owing
to the possible effect upon their practice.... If a doctor falls
out with his patient he loses the entire family (par. 120).</p>

<p>These statements ... are representative of an enormous
volume of dissatisfaction with the action of the medical profession.</p>
</div>

<p>The Committee state:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>We are of opinion that in many cases doctors have given
certificates for sickness benefit in circumstances in which these
certificates were not justified.</p>
</div>

<p>From the standpoint of the conscientious practitioner
the present position is profoundly unsatisfactory.
He has no official access to arrangements for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
consultative and expert advice, he has no hospital beds,
no skilled nurses. For the patient the position is
anomalous and leaves him with but a fragment of
what he could reasonably expect under the terms of
the Act.</p>

<p>Of the other medical benefit, i.e., the Sanatorium
benefit and of the Maternity benefit, I can say only a
few words here. The former gives the insured patient
little more than in the more enlightened sanitary districts
is being provided, independently of insurance,
by Public Health Authorities. It would have been
practicable to make it obligatory on all Public Health
Authorities to provide adequate treatment for all consumptive
patients. They are already authorized to do
this under Public Health Acts, and the duty could
have been, and can still be made, obligatory by regulation.
And in that case the connection of the Sanatorium
Benefit with the National (Health) Insurance
Act would happily cease, and one great obstacle to a
really national organization against tuberculosis would
disappear.</p>

<p>The Maternity Benefit provides a money payment
for each insured woman and for the wife of each insured
man on the birth of a child. The money payment
is made through the Insurance Societies unconditionally,
instead of being made a means of securing
that the birth takes place under circumstances favourable
to mother and infant. During recent years public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
health authorities (aided by grants from the Government
of one half of the total approved local expenditure)
have been making medical and nursing
provision for the care of women in pregnancy, in parturition,
and during the nursing period, on a rapidly
increasing scale, the grants including not only skilled
assistance but also domestic aid (home helps) in suitable
cases. There can be no question that increased
provision in these directions will have a more generally
beneficial influence than money payments, and should
at least supplement the latter.</p>

<p>To sum up, if the national English system of insurance
is to continue, it ought in my view to be shorn
of its medical functions and to be limited to money
payments during sickness, in return for the weekly
contribution made by employees and employers. If it
be thought inadvisable to limit the State’s contribution,
as in Germany, to what is spent in administration,
then in equity the present system of insurance cannot
continue to be limited to those now participating in it.</p>

<p>I hold strongly that the State should embark on a
much larger scale than at present on</p>


<h3><em>The State Treatment of Disease</em></h3>

<p>The great and fundamental mistake made in the
initiation of the English Insurance Act was that in
effect it ignored the entire history of the relation of
preventive and curative medicine to the State. This
history cannot be detailed now: but, briefly, for long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
years the destitute had been entitled to domiciliary
and institutional treatment at the public expense.
This medical aid was given by Poor Law Authorities,
and their method of doing this work had rendered the
benefaction commonly unacceptable. Then Public
Health Authorities on a steadily increasing scale found
it necessary to treat disease in order the more effectively
to prevent it. And so fevers and smallpox, and
chronic infective diseases like tuberculosis and syphilis
came under treatment, practically for all comers, at
the public expense. As already mentioned the fundamental
importance of maternity and childhood has also
been realised, and the State is now taking an increasing
share in ensuring health at these periods of life.
And while Public Health Authorities were increasing
their activities, Education Authorities began to subject
school children to medical inspection, and to
treat them for the detected defects, the treatment
of which they could not otherwise secure. And so,
not to make this sketch too complex, three great central
government departments or sub-departments and
three sets of local authorities were engaged in medically
treating the people at the public expense. This
sketch does not include the smaller (nevertheless
enormous) amount of treatment of disease by voluntary
hospitals. It is safe to state that at any one time
one-half of the total treatment of disease is being carried
out at the public expense. If the domiciliary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
treatment of insured persons is worthy to come into
the same category as the skilled services mentioned
above, the proportion of disease already treated at the
public expense greatly exceeds 50 per cent. (Note.—Less
than four-ninths of the cost of medical treatment
of insured persons comes from the contributions of
the insured.)</p>

<p>The complexity of local authorities concerned in the
treatment of disease was wilfully increased under the
National (Health) Insurance Act; and, contrary to
the advice of public health workers and of the Royal
Commission on the Poor Laws a golden opportunity
for securing the merging of poor law into public health
work and for initiating a unified system of State Medicine
for all who need it was lost.</p>

<p>Poverty to a preponderant extent is due to sickness.
Two statements have recently been made by the Medical
Society of the State of New York, viz., that “evidence
is against the fact that any considerable amount
of impoverishment is caused by illness,” and that they
can find no “available evidence that ... in the main,
medical attendance in this State is grossly deficient in
quantity or grossly defective in quality.” (<cite>Monthly
Labor Review</cite>, January, 1920, p. 256.)</p>

<p>One can admire the optimism, while denying the accuracy
of the first statement: of the second statement,
as it refers to the State of New York, I can say
nothing, except that a statement identical with the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
denied above would be literally true for England. In
1907 I wrote, “the coexistent but uncoördinated systems
of treatment of disease have failed lamentably
to provide what the health of the community requires—means
for ensuring effectively the early recognition
and proper treatment of all disease” (<cite>British Medical
Journal</cite>, Sept. 14, ’07). That remains broadly true,
and no remedy will suffice which does not ensure for
every member of the community in essential particulars
as good treatment as the most favored now
possess.</p>

<p>The socialization of medicine has gone too far, its
beneficent effects are becoming too well appreciated,
to render it possible, even were it not undesirable and
mischievous, to hinder its further extension. We have
travelled more than half the road towards the goal of
general provision of skilled medical assistance by coöperative
means, i.e., out of the communal purse. If
this is desirable for elementary general education, it
is even more important when the aim is the restoration
and the maintenance of the highest attainable level of
health for each member of the community, who is
willing to share in the offered benefits. If we include
the third of the total population who now receive in
Great Britain the unsatisfactory medical benefit under
the National (Health) Insurance Act, and remember
the rapidly increasing scope of voluntary and official institutional
treatment of disease, hesitation in accepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the inevitable should be replaced by a determination
to guide future developments and to render them efficient
and economical. What is good for the public is
good also for the members of the medical profession.</p>

<p>If asked to advise on the steps which it is advisable
to take in regard to Sickness Insurance in a community
which has not adopted a scheme, I should emphasise
the prior necessity for the State to secure a completely
satisfactory system of public medical care before engaging
in the more difficult task of providing monetary
payments in sickness. It is well to bear in mind that
medical attendance is a form of communal assistance
the demand for which does not tend to increase with
the supply; whereas monetary benefits have always
shown this trend, as demonstrated by the experience
of both Friendly Societies and charitable agencies.
As satisfactory administration of monetary benefits
during sickness depends on securing medical certification
which is above suspicion, it is fundamentally important
that under any method of public medical
attendance the certification (for incapacity to work)
should be completely independent of any coexistent
system of sickness insurance.</p>

<p>A completely efficient public medical service, if preventive
as well as curative, will diminish greatly the
monetary calls on sickness insurance and lower its
expense. Let me briefly enumerate the conditions
which such a medical service must fulfil:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>1. It must possess facilities for consultations with
physicians and surgeons having special knowledge,
equalling in efficiency those possessed by the well-to-do.</p>

<p>2. All modern pathological and physical aids to
diagnosis and treatment must be available.</p>

<p>3. Hospital treatment must be secured for all whose
illness cannot be satisfactorily treated at home.</p>

<p>4. In the ordinary treatment of patients by medical
practitioners there must be provision for team work,
as for instance at local dispensaries, so that a patient
may, where this is desirable be conveniently examined
by several doctors. (Group medicine.)</p>

<p>5. Skilled nursing must be obtainable for patients
needing to be treated at home, though the extent to
which this is required will be greatly reduced by increased
use of hospital beds.</p>

<p>6. In every district the patient might have the choice
between several doctors; but unnecessary change of
doctors should be discouraged. Subject to general
regulations, however, he should be entitled to demand
a consultation when not satisfied as to his treatment.</p>

<p>7. The doctor chosen by the head of the family
should be held responsible for supervising the health
of the whole family; and should be required at least
once in three months to arrange to see each member
of it, to ascertain any existing disease, or any habits,
manner of life or work tending to cause disease, and
to make a concise statement to the medical officer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
health or health commissioner embodying his recommendations
as to any public health action which may
be needed.</p>

<p>8. The scheme at first might be limited to one section
of the population, but there is no reason why ultimately
it should not embrace all willing to join it.</p>

<p>9. The remuneration of doctors engaging in this
public work should be adequate at once to attract junior
members of the profession. The remuneration
should not be on a capitation basis, but by salary,
modified according to the success achieved. The
scheme would enable doctors to have ample leisure
and holidays and to take part in post-graduate courses.
Every inducement should be given to physicians to
undertake along with their family work special work
in connection with one of the following activities:</p>


<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>Pathological laboratories,</li>
<li>Hospitals,</li>
<li>Health centres for infants and mothers,</li>
<li>Prenatal and post-natal clinics,</li>
<li>Consultant obstetric work,</li>
<li>Pre-school clinics,</li>
<li>School medical inspection and clinics,</li>
<li>Industrial inspections and clinics, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>10. Medical schemes on the above general lines can
only be completely satisfactory to the extent to which
every physician taking part in them becomes imbued
with an appreciation of the <em>almost unlimited preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
possibilities opened up by the opportunity to
treat disease</em>, and by the realization likewise that an
essential part of his family work should consist in
detecting the <em>beginnings of disease</em> and in detecting
and securing the removal of domestic, dietetic, housing,
industrial or other factors liable to cause disease.</p>

<p>If these ideals can be even partially realised, we
shall have approached the time when every practising
physician will become a hygienist, and when any sickness
insurance still demanded or required will be on a
scale much lower than is necessary at the present time.
In short, compulsory sickness insurance under present
conditions is a measure of relief. It has almost as
little prevention involved in it, as has insurance against
the risk of fire. Relief must be given, by insurance or
otherwise. How much preferable, however, it would
be to precede it by a far-reaching scheme of effective
preventive and curative work, or at the least to place
it in a strictly subsidiary position to such a scheme in
actual operation!</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">Some Problems of Preventive Medicine of the
Immediate Future</span><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The Great War has changed our outlook on social,
including medical, problems; and has made all of us
consider anxiously in the midst of the terrible wreckage
from war, what useful lessons may be garnered
for our future guidance. In speaking of losses, I am
not referring to financial burdens, though these are
fabulously high—the bare statement that the British
national debt has increased from 645 to near 8,000
millions sterling, brings this home—and we shall,
most of us, go relatively poor for the rest of our lives
and our children likewise. Nothing but the most
effective and scientific use of our energies on the part
of workers of every class can save us from protracted
poverty.</p>

<p>I am thinking rather, however, of the losses of life
and limb, of hearing and eyesight, and of reason, which
have been experienced—one or other—in nearly every
other family in the British Empire, and which show
once more the wantonness of war: how cheaply life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
is held by it, how careless it is of the individual; and
how disregardful it is of human promise and performance.</p>

<p>The destruction of over 700,000 lives of sharers in
our common Empire, killed in battle or dead from
wounds, represents an imperial loss, a terrible destruction
of the real capital of the Empire—its manhood—and
of the flower of that manhood; and generations
will come and go before the Empire recovers
completely.</p>


<h3><em>Gains from War</em></h3>

<p>But we can set out some great gains from war.</p>

<p>1. Not the least of these is the fact that the fears
entertained by the more pessimistic that we had become
enervated and decadent have been falsified on
many a stricken field; and not less in the strenuous
work of those who have worked remote from the battlefield.
Our men and many women also have shown
themselves willing to give their lives for great impersonal
ends. Their lives have been sacrificed—for our
children, for liberty, for peace, for security against
military barbarism, and for high ideals of life. The
emergence of such a high proportion of our total population
from selfishness and self-centred life to a sacrificial
position, raises hope that rightly directed appeal
to the collective self of the community during peace
time for aid against the horrors of peace—especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
those caused by disease—will also succeed in enlisting
the assistance of the majority of the population and
thus removing the vast mass of removable disease and
disablement which now prevails.</p>

<p>2. The war has knitted together in active comradeship
the Old Country and its younger and more energetic
children in the Dominion of Canada and in other
parts of the British Empire, in bonds of mutual indebtedness
and gratitude and in admiration of great deeds,
in a manner and to an extent which must forever preclude
misunderstanding or separation.</p>

<p>In these two respects especially—and in others which
I shall dwell on more fully—we can, as Wordsworth
put it, when commenting on the wars of the French

<h3><em>The Work of Women</em></h3>

<p>3. The war has revealed to us the great extent to
which women in emergencies can replace men. I need
not repeat the story of how women in a few months
mastered mechanical intricacies in munition works, for
which previously a long training was thought necessary;
nor how educated women after a few months’
intensive training were able, under war conditions, to
undertake the work of fully trained nurses. We cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
ignore these facts; and in regard to nursing, they
should lead us to consider whether, under modern conditions
of life, it is necessary that the great body of
nurses, like the great majority of medical practitioners,
need to be experts in major operations, and whether
they should not be trained chiefly from the standpoint
of the ordinary illnesses of the household. Particularly,
it is important to recognize that the training of
the health visitor or public health nurse must diverge
at an early period of training from that of the clinical
nurse.</p>

<p>In another direction women are about to influence
vitally the problems of public health in the near future.
The municipal and parliamentary vote has been given
to women in England, and is not likely long to be
withheld here. How will they use it? When they
use it will “politics” be a name for a contemptible
thing as it has become in some towns and states, or
will women insist on clean administration and efficient
work to secure the health and welfare of the community?</p>


<h3><em>Prohibition of Alcoholic Drinks</em></h3>

<p>4. The prohibition law against alcoholic drinks in
the U. S. A. is largely the work of American women.
Whatever view be taken of this law—and I regard it
as one of the most significant social events of the age—let
there be no doubt as to the essential facts of the
problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Alcoholism is a potent enemy of the race. It is a
great creator of avoidable poverty. It makes the bed
ready for tuberculosis. It is a frequent excitant of
exposure to the infection of venereal diseases; it swells
the ranks of fatherless children, and of neglected infants;
it helps to fill our prisons and our hospitals.
Let it be admitted, if you like, that light wines and
beers are pleasant, and in strict moderation with meals
are beverages to which little or no harm can be traced;
but heavier drinks and all non-medicinal spirit drinking
are to be condemned; and the country which distinguishes
itself by abolishing these drinks will, other
things being equal, in my opinion, inevitably attain
quickly an industrial and economic superiority over all
countries which continue to follow the older ways.</p>

<p>5. A great gain during the war is constituted by the
fact that science has come into its own. The war has
been described as a war of engineers. Its chief successes
have been won largely by applied science; and
it is gratifying to record that the Anglo-Saxon intellectuals,
when their services have been engaged, have
proved themselves more than equal to the German
scientist, whether in physics or chemistry or medicine.</p>

<p>The facts as to the wonderful extent to which disease
has been prevented during this war need not be
detailed. Intestinal diseases have been kept strictly
under control. In no previous war has smallpox or
typhoid fever claimed so small a toll on the belligerents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Malaria, it is true, has claimed many victims, owing
to our soldiers having to operate in countries in which
the needed precautions could not be completely carried
out. Typhus has scarcely claimed a victim among the
British forces, and although trench fever was common,
medical discovery, by showing its relationship to the
bite of the louse, has placed within reach an immediately
practicable means for avoiding this serious
cause of military disablement.</p>

<p>Three sets of diseases have not been successfully
combatted during the war—the group of respiratory
affections, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases, and on
each of these it is desirable to make a few remarks.</p>


<h3><em>Respiratory Diseases</em></h3>

<p>6. In the group of respiratory diseases I think we
should include a number of diseases not commonly
regarded as such, but in which, so far as can be judged,
infection is received by inhalation; and I would, therefore,
group together such miscellaneous diseases as
poliomyelitis, cerebro-spinal fever, measles, bronchitis,
pneumonia, and influenza. All agree in one particular,
that attempted preventive measures against their
spread are dubious in effect. These diseases naturally
divide themselves into two groups: the first comprising
measles and influenza, both of which spread—when,
as in influenza, the almost unknown conditions
determining spread are present—to an extent only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
limited by the failure of susceptible persons; and the
second comprising the other diseases already enumerated,
of the conditions determining attack from
which we are profoundly ignorant. We do know,
however, concerning cerebro-spinal fever and measles,
that they spread more easily and become more severe
under conditions of massive overcrowding; and their
unusual severity in war is thus partially explained.
Beyond this obvious indication for prevention we can
do but little.</p>

<p>It may, however, be mentioned, that in England
during the last few years, we have determined that
our lack of ability to prevent outbreaks of measles
shall not prevent us from attempts to <em>diminish their
fatality</em>, and the notification of this disease has therefore
been enforced, as a necessary preliminary to
prompt and fairly complete action, and local authorities
have been urged to provide nurses to assist in the
domiciliary nursing of cases of measles. Grants of
half the expenditure expended in nursing this and
some other children’s diseases are paid by the Central
Government. If the spread of infection cannot be
stayed, it is our duty to diminish the loss of life
by providing nursing assistance whenever required.
This provision of nursing assistance in a number of
children’s and maternal illnesses, half the expenditure
being paid from Central and half from local funds,
will, I trust, soon be followed by a general provision
of nursing assistance from public funds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>The recent epidemic of influenza has taught us several
important lessons—First, we have been painfully
reminded that we are completely ignorant of the causes
of the pandemic waves of this terrible disease, which,
at irregular intervals of years, traverse the world. We
may surmise that the crowding and the mental and
physical depression of war caused increased rapidity
of spread and a greater fatality in the present outbreak;
but influenza has spread and been only less
fatal than in the present outbreak when there was no
war, and we must admit our ignorance of the cause
of this.</p>

<p>Numerous investigators in many lands have been
striving to illumine our ignorance; but until success
crowns their efforts, it is well to admit that on the
large scale all attempts to prevent the spread of influenza
have failed.</p>

<p>But, in this disease, as in measles, this failure in
prevention is no reason for refraining from every possible
effort to restrain death. In every country and in
nearly every invaded district, many sick were unable
to obtain adequate nursing and other domestic care.
Here and there organized mobile team work partially
overcame the difficulty; but the one lesson which
emerges from this great pandemic is the necessity for
having in every area a large nursing reserve. Here is
one of many spheres of utility, which should, I think,
be occupied by Red Cross workers, who have done
such admirable work during the Great War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Many of these Red Cross workers were not fully
trained before the war, but intelligent workers under
stress of circumstances showed themselves competent
in many instances to undertake highly skilled work;
while a much larger number under the supervision of
more fully trained nurses and doctors were able to
carry out satisfactorily the routine but still extremely
important work, of ordinary nursing. During the influenza
outbreak many such “Nursing Aids” did
admirable work, and the epidemic has demonstrated
once for all the absolute necessity of having available
a large number of such nursing aids. Cannot these
be employed on a large scale when no epidemic is
raging? Is it necessary for every case of sickness
that a fully-trained nurse should be engaged? Would
not the physician be equally satisfied in a large proportion
of his cases, if he had available a less elaborately
trained assistant, who understood personal hygiene
thoroughly, who could give an enema, could take
temperatures, and would follow instructions implicitly
and intelligently?</p>

<p>Incidentally I consider that some such modified and
simplified training in actual nursing would form an
adequate background for the special training required
to obtain a competent school nurse, tuberculosis nurse,
or public health nurse (health visitor); and that under
present conditions a three years’ training as a nurse is
not the best foundation on which to build the special
training required for these public health nurses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>


<h3><em>Tuberculosis</em></h3>

<p>7. A serious penalty of war conditions has been the
increase of tuberculosis. It is not surprising that the
crowding in barracks, the overwork and overstrain,
the dirtier habits, and risks from expectoration in
massed communities, should have increased tuberculosis
among soldiers; both by activating latent tuberculosis
and by introducing new infection. Nor is it
surprising that under analogous conditions tuberculosis
has increased among women, especially at the
ages in which the enormous increase in their industrial
employment has taken place.</p>

<p>The national anti-tuberculosis arrangements which
were made in connection with the National Insurance
Act had scarcely been fully organized when the war
began. At an early stage it had become plain that in
essentials non-insured must be provided for as well
as insured, and Government grants of half the approved
expenditure on the treatment of tuberculosis
in the general population endorsed this principle.
There was no reason, therefore, for the continued
separate existence of the “Sanatorium Benefit”; and
had it not been for political considerations the treatment
of tuberculosis would probably already have been
handed over to public health authorities, while leaving
intact the general provisions of the National Insurance
Act as to monetary payments and benefits. The same
transference should apply also to the treatment of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
disease undertaken at the public expense. The treatment
of disease, especially in its more difficult specialist
and institutional branches, should become a matter
of communal provision, to which every person would
be entitled as he is to the common provision under our
system of elementary education, or to the common use
of free libraries and of drinking water.</p>

<p>There is needed a widely extended propaganda
against tuberculosis. The public as well as the medical
profession need to be educated, the latter in the
carrying out of complete and prompt notification of
cases of the disease, and in the use of all facilities provided
for aiding diagnosis; the former in the risks of
industrial and other dust infections, of indiscriminate
expectoration, of alcoholism, of imperfect nutrition,
of bad housing, and so on. We all need to learn the
folly of imperfect measures against tuberculosis. Complete
success can only be attained if we assume responsibility
for the whole course of the life of the
consumptive. Not only must educational sanatoria
be provided—and, still more important—hospital treatment
for all the emergencies of the disease and in
advanced disease; but in the quiescent intervals assistance
must be forthcoming to cover the margin between
a living wage and the earning capacity of the ex-patient,
and economic assistance must be provided for
protecting the patient, and still more his family, from
defective nutrition and from infection. To stop short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of this is to be extravagantly parsimonious; to do this
is to economize in sickness and to secure increased
efficiency in future generations. What better work
can be thought of for Red Cross volunteers than in
supplementing the work already carried out by anti-tuberculosis
organizations and in extending and systematizing
these agencies. Is not such peace work
equal in importance with the war work which Red
Cross workers have already accomplished?</p>


<h3><em>Venereal Diseases</em></h3>

<p>8. Venus and Mars are always closely associated,
and it is a lamentable fact that one heritage of the war
will be a great increase of venereal diseases in our
midst. In England we had become thoroughly aroused
to the magnitude of this evil even in peace time. The
report of the Royal Commission on Venereal Diseases
and the propaganda since actively carried out, have
led to the taking of measures which I can only briefly
enumerate. The duty has been imposed on every
county and county borough council of providing aids
to pathological diagnosis, and of providing clinics for
the treatment of these diseases for all comers, irrespective
of residential or monetary conditions. These
clinics have been generally started throughout the
country, and their use has been widely advertised and
encouraged by propaganda in the form of lectures and
addresses in factories and to various social groups,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and by public advertisement. In addition an enactment
has been secured absolutely prohibiting the treatment
of venereal diseases except by qualified medical
practitioners, and prohibiting the advertising or offering
for sale of any remedy for venereal diseases. In
addition, arsenobenzol preparations are supplied to
medical practitioners who have experience in their use
for their own patients.</p>

<p>These measures do not cover the entire ground.
The enforcement of police regulations against vice, the
detention of infectious persons who cannot be trusted
to refrain from spreading disease, the raising of the
general standard of sexual morality—until public opinion
demands that it shall be as high for men as for
women—are among the reforms which are called for.</p>

<p>In encouraging social reform in these directions Red
Cross workers have a most fruitful field of work, and
they can render invaluable assistance in removing a
canker which at present eats into the vitals of the
community, and is responsible for untold suffering in
women and children, for premature old age and paralysis
in men, and for a large share of the total inmates
of our lunatic asylums.</p>


<h3><em>The Mother and the Child</em></h3>

<p>9. I have left myself but scant time to speak of
what is at once a chief lesson of the war and the
most pressing problem in the preventive medicine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the immediate future. I refer to the need for more
complete protection of motherhood and childhood
against the dangers besetting them.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to assume that only since war
began have efforts both by sanitary authorities and by
voluntary agencies been made on a large scale to diminish
infantile and maternal mortality. But during
the war, and since it terminated, these efforts have
been redoubled and are becoming universal; and there
is opening out a prospect of safe maternity for mothers
and of protected infancy for all newcomers on the
stage of life. If only we are prepared to do what is
almost immediately practicable for this end, death or
injury associated with child-bearing will become rare,
the loss of infant and child life will be halved, and
what is still more important, mothers and infants will
cease to be damaged by neglect or ignorance at critical
periods of their life, and will not become burdens to
themselves and to the community.</p>

<p>This is no visionary dream. Past experience shows
that it is within reach. What other interpretations
can be placed on the facts revealed in official reports?</p>

<p>I am unable to quote Canadian figures; but I am
justified in assuming that differences similar to these
I am about to quote from my own reports exist also
here. The average number of deaths of mothers from
complications arising during pregnancy, and at or
after confinement, are one maternal death for every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
250 infants born alive. In some parts of England
instead of four mothers, six or even eight or nine
mothers die for every thousand infants born. There
are marked differences in maternal mortality in neighbouring
towns and districts; and the only conclusion
which fits in with the facts is that, in many parts of
the country, the arrangements for medical attendance
on mothers at and before their confinement are inadequate
or deficient in quality or both.</p>

<p>The Maternity Benefit under the National Insurance
Act, though a valuable evidence of the interest of the
State in maternity, has not provided a sufficient remedy.
It was an unconditional benefit limited to insured
women or the wives of insured men, and there
was no guarantee that the money allotted would be
utilized in supplying the medical, midwifery, or nursing
assistance needed by the patient, or in relieving
her from domestic duties which she is unfit to perform.
It was furthermore, inadequate for these purposes.
We should not think of handing over to each
individual householder an annual sum of money, advising
him to expend it on a supply of books or in the
education of his children. It is more economical and
more effective to provide free libraries and public elementary
schools without payment of fees. Is not
similar action important in connection with child-bearing,
on which the continuity of family life and
civilization depends? That this is so is recognized in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the steps towards the desired end taken in recent years
by the Local Government Board jointly with local authorities.
Let me enumerate some of these. The
Central Authority have undertaken to pay one-half of
approved expenditure incurred locally on the following
agencies:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The salaries and expenses of inspectors of midwives;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The salaries and expenses of health visitors and
nurses engaged in maternity and child welfare work;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The provision of a midwife for necessitous
women in confinement and for areas which are insufficiently
supplied with this service;</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The provision, for necessitous women, of a
doctor for illness connected with pregnancy and for
aid during the period of confinement for mother and
child;</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) The expenses of a Centre, i.e., an institution
providing any or all of the following activities: Medical
supervision and service for expectant and nursing
mothers, and for children under five years of age, and
medical treatment at the Centre for cases needing it;</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Arrangements for instruction in the general hygiene
of maternity and childhood;</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Hospital treatment provided or contracted for
by local authorities for complicated cases of confinement
or complications arising after parturition, or for
cases in which a woman to be confined suffers from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
illness or deformity, or for cases of women who, in
the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health cannot
with safety be confined in their homes or such other
provision for securing proper conditions for the confinement
of necessitous women as may be approved
by the Medical Officer of Health;</p>

<p>(<em>h</em>) Hospital treatment provided or contracted for
by local authorities for children under five years of
age found to need in-patient treatment;</p>

<p>(<em>i</em>) The cost of food provided for expectant mothers
and nursing mothers and for children under five years
of age, where such provision is certified by the Medical
Officer of the Centre or by the Medical Officer of
Health to be necessary and where the case is necessitous;</p>

<p>(<em>j</em>) Expenses of creches and day nurseries and of
other arrangements for attending to the health of children
under five years of age, whose mothers go out
to work;</p>

<p>(<em>k</em>) The provision of accommodation in convalescent
homes for nursing mothers and for children under
five years of age;</p>

<p>(<em>l</em>) The provision of homes and other arrangements
for attending to the health of children of widowed,
deserted and unmarried mothers, under five years of
age;</p>

<p>(<em>m</em>) Experimental work for the health of expectant
and nursing mothers and of infants and children under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
five years of age, carried out by local authorities or
voluntary agencies with the approval of the Board;</p>

<p>(<em>n</em>) Contributions by the local authority to voluntary
institutions and agencies approved under the
scheme.</p>

<p>Grants will be paid to voluntary agencies aided by
the Board on condition:</p>

<p>1. That the work of the agency is approved by the
Board and coördinated as far as practicable with the
public health work of the local authority and the school
medical service of the local education authority.</p>

<p>2. That the premises and work of the institution are
subject to inspection by any of the Board officer’s or
inspectors.</p>

<p>3. That records of the work done by the agency are
kept to the satisfaction of the Board.</p>

<p>Possibly much of the past failure to protect maternity
and to reduce the still-births and mortality among
infants under a month old has been due to the erroneous
assumption that damage to health and life at
these times is in the main inevitable. That this is not
so for maternal mortality is proved by the great difference
in experience of sickness and death for mothers
in different social strata and according to the availability
of skilled midwives and doctors. There are
similar differences locally and socially in the proportion
of still-births. Wassermann tests, followed by
appropriate medical action, in all instances in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
there have been previous miscarriages or in which for
other reasons syphilis comes under suspicion, and subsequent
action based on the diagnosis thus secured,
would at once greatly reduce maternal and infantile
mortality. So also would systematic examination of
urine during pregnancy and the ascertainment that in
other respects the physical conditions of normal parturition
are present. These are adequate reasons for
the establishment of ante-natal consultations, which
happily are rapidly increasing in England under the
stimulus of the Government grants already mentioned.</p>

<p>The further fact that about one-third of the total
deaths in the first year after live-birth occur in the
first four weeks of life, adds force to my plea for the
establishment of these ante-natal consultations in connection
with all lying-in institutions and at child welfare
centres, where infants and children up to school
age will be submitted to periodical medical examination
and supervision.</p>

<p>It has been erroneously asserted that the greater
part of this early infant mortality is unavoidable; but
careful examination of national and local statistics
shows that in some places it is twice as high as in others,
and examination of the causes of death in the districts
with more favourable mortality shows that their experience
can be improved. All experienced obstetricians
and pædiatricians will agree that, given adequate
care of the mother during pregnancy, skilled care by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a competent obstetrician during labor, and satisfactory
medical and nursing care in the following month, there
can be secured large reductions in the early infant
mortality of the first month after birth, as well as in
the number of still-births and in the present toll on
maternal life.</p>

<p>In early infancy, as in advanced old age, the hold on
life is slight, normal and abnormal are soon interchanged,
and there is needed not only more knowledge
on the part of mothers and nurses, and even of physicians,
of the hygienic side of medicine as applied to
the physiological life of the mother and her infant,
but also personal care and assistance to enable the
mother to apply the useful information and advice
given by the public health nurse. I lay special stress
on this association of counsel and assistance. It is
important also that nursing and medical assistance
should be so given as not to create a feeling of dependence.
In view of the wide provision of medical
assistance from public funds which already obtains,
I submit that poverty tests in the giving of such assistance
should be abolished, or that, at least, the
availability of such assistance should be greatly extended.
Given the fulfilment of this condition, it will
be practicable to enlist the remunerated coöperation
of the medical profession in a general provision of
medical and nursing facilities, which will secure the
early detection of disease of every kind and its prompt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
and adequate treatment. Not only so, but the same
service can be utilized for the preservation of health
by securing the change of habits and customs and conditions
of housing or work which are likely to prove
detrimental.</p>

<p>I have laid stress on the ideal after which we must,
in my opinion, strive. Meanwhile, it is essential that
we should not regard the mere removal of ignorance
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>. This is plain when we come
into close contact with the facts of life as lived by the
greater part of the wage-earning classes.</p>

<p>Has the wife of the wage-earner domestic help such
as her well-to-do sister possesses? Is there a nurse
to help her even when the children are sick, much less
while they remain fairly healthy? How often has
every kettle-full of water to be heated separately on a
stove? Under such circumstances is it reasonable to
expect the cleanliness which is an indispensable condition
of health? Is there a clean supply of milk for
every working-man’s family and are there arrangements
for sanitary and cool storage of food in his
dwelling?</p>

<p>And so we might go on multiplying questions, knowing
that, if the answers are well-informed and candid,
they will confess that the mothers of the wage-earning
classes, especially in our large cities—in England, if
not also here—have not a fair chance to keep themselves
well, or to rear a healthy and robust family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>I do not wish to stress this view of the case; but I
have said enough to justify the action of the British
Government in deciding during the war—and announcing
the fact in more than one official circular
issued to all Local Authorities by the Local Government
Board—that, next to the active pursuance of
war, measures for promoting maternal and child welfare
ranked next in importance, and that no efforts
must be spared to continue and extend such measures.
And the history of the last four years shows that this
has been done. The central grants for special maternal
and child welfare work undertaken by local authorities
and voluntary agencies have increased twelve-fold,
the number of health visitors has been more than
doubled, and the number of maternity and child welfare
centres has increased five-fold; and coincident
with these facts, infant mortality, which was falling
before the war, has continued to decline steadily during
the war,—the corrected figures for the years 1912-17
respectively were 104, 117, 113, 111, 98, and 94—although
the number of mothers employed away from
home has greatly increased during the same period.</p>


<h3><em>The Work of Voluntary Agencies</em></h3>

<p>I have several times in this address mentioned the
valuable work of voluntary health agencies. No official
can fail to recognize that pioneer work is commonly
started by them; and it has often happened that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
only when the evidence of its value has become obtrusive
has it been taken over by local authorities.
This is the true function of voluntary agencies, and
will remain so, until local authorities (which after all
are manned by voluntary workers) become saturated
with the ideals of voluntary workers and of the new
women-voters. Local authorities always have one
great advantage over voluntary societies, that their
action can be supported by legal powers.</p>

<p>The proper attitude of voluntary workers is to initiate
and demonstrate the value of reforms, to persuade
local authorities to adopt them, themselves to
become members of these local authorities to ensure
this end, and thus eventually render the voluntary
organization for the object in question superfluous.
There need be no fear; openings for further desirable
voluntary work will always appear, as official work
increases. In the main, however, the care of the health
of the people is a governmental function, whether it
has to do with the prevention of sickness or the satisfactory
medical treatment and nursing of the sick.</p>

<p>There is no early prospect of voluntary workers becoming
unnecessary; for average human nature, as
represented on governmental bodies, is shortsighted
and needs much education, morally and intellectually,
before it will undertake the whole sphere of work
called for in the interest of the welfare of the mother
and her child. Hence my plea that the magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
potentialities of the Red Cross organization should not
be allowed to fall into abeyance; that they should replace
their relief work by preventive work; that, to
use a well-known simile, they should erect a parapet
at the top of a dangerous cliff as well as provide ambulances
at its foot. In so doing they will, I am confident,
not encroach on present successful work of
existing bodies concerned with promoting child welfare,
or with the prevention of tuberculosis or of
venereal diseases, or with existing agencies for providing
nurses for the poor. But they can supplement
the efforts of these organizations; they can bring
monetary as well as personal assistance; and they can,
above all, bring a mass of public opinion to bear on
local and central governing bodies which will lead to
the only real economy, which consists in expenditure
on an adequate scale, bringing to the aid of the families
of the people the preventive, the medical, and the
nursing facilities of which they remain in need.</p>

<p>On examining the local city directory, one cannot
but be impressed by the multiplicity of voluntary organizations
having for their object the immediate relief
of destitution or the social or economic “uplift”
of sections of the population. The multiplicity of
these agencies becomes more striking when one remembers
that probably every one of the hundreds of
churches and chapels in the city has its periodical sacramental
and other collections for the poor, and may
have also a system of parochial district visiting, with
such auxiliary assistance as is provided through
mothers’ meetings, etc. Nor does this exhaust the
possibilities of social help available for the poorer
members of society in cities in which there is a satisfactory
distribution of rich and poor, that is, in which
the segregation of different social strata in separate
areas has happily not befallen. There is the further
help provided by individual charity, the amount of
which in the aggregate probably exceeds beneficence
through churches and social agencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>If these different agencies could pool their resources,
while retaining the enthusiasm and driving power of
separate organization, what an economy of effort and
what increase of efficiency would result, especially if
these agencies were also satisfactorily related to the
official organizations of local and central governing
bodies having the same object!</p>

<p>But I am not concerned this evening to discuss the
machinery of social help or the attempts already made
in different centres for securing their satisfactory coöperation.
Nor am I disposed to discuss the economic
problems underlying the need for social assistance of
the poor. Ideally we must agree with St. Augustine’s
statement: “Thou givest bread to the hungry; but
better were it, that none hungered, and that thou
had’st none to give him.” My present object, however,
is to set out some elementary—and when stated fairly
obvious—considerations bearing on social evils and
their remedies under present conditions of society,
the recollection of which if followed by practical action,
would secure greatly increased efficiency in social
work.</p>

<p>For the following reasons I do not hesitate to bring
this subject before a gathering of graduate medical
students:</p>

<p>First.—Every physician as soon as he engages in
medical practice almost immediately comes into touch
with organized and unorganized social workers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
his success—personal as well as communal—can almost
be measured in terms of his outlook towards their
work;</p>

<p>Second.—The physician, with his scientific training
in the tracing of effects back to their causes, is in a
specially favourable position to promote rational as
contradistinguished from empirical social help; and</p>

<p>Third.—The physician is now learning to appreciate
that he can only treat his patients satisfactorily in the
light of knowledge of their social, including housing
conditions, of their industrial relationships, and of
their personal history and habits of life.</p>

<p>This is the age of anxiety to give social help.</p>

<p>I hold strongly the view that ere many of you are
advanced in years the fundamentally important social
help which is constituted by adequate medical attendance
will be provided, for all who wish to have it thus,
at the expense of the state, i.e., coöperatively by means
of common charges on every member of the community
according to his means, exactly as elementary
education is now provided. This will involve radical
reconstruction of the relationship between hospital and
private medical practice, and will, I trust, include also
the introduction of preventive medicine into the practice
of every physician. But this is in the future.
How can medical practice under present conditions,
and how can non-medical social agencies, be made subservient
to the fullest extent to the welfare of the community?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>A few elementary illustrations will show the many
unexploited or only partially exploited or misused
opportunities for efficient social help.</p>

<p>The greatest science is to know the causes of things;
and there is no branch of work in which this is more
important than in medicine. But causation is complex.
A given result commonly follows from a chain,
or it may be a bundle of events: and as we shall
shortly see the end links of the chain are oftimes
joined, thus forming a circle.</p>

<p>If a man shoots a companion with whom he has
quarrelled, it may be urged that a more rigid system
of license for the use of firearms would have prevented
the calamity; that the companion was also quarrelsome;
that the homicide had been the spoiled child of
his mother and had not had a satisfactory up-bringing;
and that he inherited from his father a violent temper;
but none of these circumstances,—all of which may
have contributed to the murder,—is likely to succeed
in preventing the murderer from being hanged after
due trial.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more striking instance
of the linking of elements in causation than in the
origin of a case of malaria. For the transmission of
this disease two human beings, one already infected
with the specific contagium, and a mosquito are required,
and the chain of causation can be broken at
the infecting person, by strict screening from mosquitos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
and by the use of quinine; at the mosquito by
preventing its emergence from the larval stage, and
later by preventing its access to the patient; or at the
prospective patient, possibly by prophylactic medication,
more certainly by strict screening from mosquitos.
Hence one might claim lack of segregation
of infected persons, lack of screening of the healthy,
failure to drain marshes, to apply oil to the surface
of stagnant pools, or to adopt allied measures destroying
the larvae of mosquitos as each of them the cause
of malarial disease.</p>

<p>There is a constant excess of sickness among the
poor as compared with the well-to-do. Measures for
the relief of poverty, therefore, may be regarded as
within the scope of the physician’s prescription. This
may be accomplished for the moment by monetary or
material help; but unless the causes of poverty are
sought out and counteracted, the assistance given is
merely palliative. For nothing is more certain than
that poverty tends to become a self-perpetuating condition.</p>

<p>Thus poverty leads to premature employment of
children, with detriment to their normal growth, followed
by diminished efficiency in adult life. This implies
low wages throughout life, and so poverty is
passed on to a second generation.</p>

<p>Evidently timely assistance to induce the parent to
delay employing the boy, until he has been prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
for work, and to ensure his being put to work which
will not be a “blind-alley” occupation, might have obviated
the evil chain of events.</p>

<p>Poverty again when carried to the point of destitution
may tempt to larceny; this may be followed by
loss of employment, and so the temporary unrelieved
poverty is liable to become permanent.</p>

<p>Intemperance has been almost wiped out as a cause
of disease in the United States; and we have in the
fact that the whole country has “gone dry” a remarkable
example of a “short-cut” towards social salvation
from alcoholism which will be most instructive. Apart
from such universal prohibition of alcoholic beverages,
the physician has to think of an alcoholic patient
under his care as the possible victim of one or more or
all of several coöperating influences conducing to intemperance.
The alcoholic habit may have been gradually
acquired as the result of protracted social indulgence
in moderation acting on a person of unstable
mental constitution; it may, especially in wage-earners,
have been hastened by the evil custom of treating. It
not infrequently follows overwork, with the associated
feeling of need for stimulants; it accompanies bad
housing, with unsatisfactory sleeping accommodation;
and it is aided by poor and badly cooked food, due to
shiftlessness, overwork, or lack of domestic training
of the man’s wife. If there is to be successful control
of alcoholism, action in all the directions briefly indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
above, and in other directions which will suggest
themselves, is necessary; and although the physician
cannot himself do all this, his efforts should run parallel
with social efforts in these directions.</p>

<p>Even when the “short-cut” of compulsory abstinence
has been taken, the efforts indicated above are
still needed; for alcoholism is not the only resultant of
bad social habits, of overwork, of unsatisfactory feeding,
of deficient sleep, and so on.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more far reaching in their evil effects
than intemperance are the Venereal Diseases. As you
know, special efforts during and since the war have
been made to limit the spread of these diseases. I do
not propose to trouble you with statistics to prove the
mischief caused by these diseases. Has not Osler said
that the whole of clinical medicine can be taught
around syphilis, and that it is the third in importance
of the killing diseases? And as a further illustration,
let me add that no less than one-tenth of the total
accommodation in our lunatic asylums might be dispensed
with if syphilis were eliminated.</p>

<p>Among the measures being taken to combat these
diseases are educational propaganda, and the provision
of clinics, free for all, at which patients may be treated
promptly and adequately. It is evident, however, that
if the medical and educational efforts now being made
are to succeed they must include recognition of all the
factors causing sexual vice, and appropriate action in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
respect of each of these—they must indeed go further
than this; for self-restraint is a wider problem than
in relation to exposure to these diseases. It embraces
the whole subject of formation of the habit of self-control.
One of the most striking facts in the great
war has been the extent to which young girls of previously
decent behaviour have fallen victims to what
has sometimes appeared to be passion combined with
a perverted form of patriotism; and one of the measures
most called for is better mothering and maternal
training of both girls and boys. The problem is one
of special difficulty as regards the economically independent
girl; and to shield her the combined efforts of
home influence, of girls’ clubs, and of various social
and religious organizations are all required.</p>

<p>Judicious and restrained teaching of the physiology
and hygiene of sex would do much to counteract the
evil influence of bad teaching by companions; and in
emphasizing this duty on parents the physician may do
untold good. So also, especially when the daughters
of his patients are about to marry “men of the world,”
he should urge the need for asking a satisfactory certificate
from the intended bridegroom of freedom
from infection.</p>

<p>The influence of unaccustomed alcoholic indulgence
in leading to the first “slip,” often with the production
of life-long disease, is well known.</p>

<p>Nor must we leave out of account the tolerance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
vice in conversation between young men, as a frequent
excuse of and even excitant to vice. The happiest
young man is he who can go to the marriage ceremony
with the same sexual purity as is even now expected
from the bride. Is it too much to expect that our
social conscience will grow up to this standard? I
think not; and when this point has been reached,
venereal diseases will have almost entirely disappeared,
and the sum total of human happiness and
efficiency will be enormously enhanced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile partial remedies must be pushed for all
they are worth—and this is much. Fear of consequences
may deter some from vice; fear of consequences
to future wife and child form a much more
potent argument. Treatment of venereal diseases, especially
of syphilis, is a most valuable means of preventing
their spread. This treatment may be urged
even at the stage after exposure to infection before
any symptoms of illness appear; and the more
promptly this is done the more successful is it. There
has been much heated debate as to whether persons
known to intend to expose themselves to possible infection
should be provided with disinfectant or other
arrangements for obviating infection. This cannot be
done without some loss of moral position; it almost
makes the provider a co-partner with the sensualist.
It may be urged, however, but with dubious cogency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
that if the man is told beforehand that immediately
afterwards he can have access to disinfectant provisions,
the same objection holds good. I do not
regard the provision of “outfits” as wise. Evidence
tends to the conclusion that they are commonly not
used efficiently; and there is a distinct loss in the
moral position by their use. The whole subject is one
of great difficulty. The prevention of venereal diseases
is clearly, however, not merely a medical problem;
and the physician who realises this and throws
the weight of his influence, in warning and in counsel,
on the side of moral restraint, is adding greatly to the
value of his social service to the community.</p>

<p>Other instances will occur to you, illustrating the
importance of a broad outlook in the causation of disease
or other forms of social misery. I will adduce
one more. It is well known that infant mortality is
much heavier among the poor than among the well-to-do.
The rule does not hold universally in rural
areas, but in towns it applies almost without exception.
And it is assumed by a large school of social
workers that enlightenment of the ignorance of the
poor mother will effectively correct this evil. Such a
lop-sided view ignores many of the elements of the
problem of infant mortality. Think for a moment of
the contrast between the working-class mother of five
children living in a small city tenement, and the
mother of an equal number of children in easy circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
living in a residential suburb, and having
domestic servants, a nurse, and a physician always
available. The two mothers probably differ but little
in their knowledge of the hygiene of infancy; but the
one has helpers to ensure scrupulous cleanliness, to
prevent over-fatigue of the nursing mother, to detect
the first sign of infantile illness and provide the
needed action; while the other mother has to struggle
alone in respect of her infant, without either domestic
or nursing assistance, the struggle being complicated
by the fact that the care of four older children and of
her husband is on her shoulders. Even when there
is no actual direct poverty in the working-class home,
the differences thus indicated—supplemented by the
inability of the mother to obtain medical advice for
apparently minor ailments—outweigh enormously the
factor of ignorance as a cause of excessive infant
mortality. By all means let instruction be given by
public health nurses or other agencies, and this is most
valuable; but it does not fully meet the needs of the
case. There is required also actual domestic, as well
as nursing, assistance in the home of the overworked
working-class mother, especially after the birth of her
infant and when illness attacks any of her children;
and unless the physician realises these elements in the
problem, his efforts in securing the welfare of his patient
and in reducing infant mortality can have but
partial success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The main lessons arising from the foregoing illustrations
of medical and social problems are two: Each
evil should be attacked in its causal relationships; and
causation is multiple.</p>

<p>Hence—apart from total prohibition—in attacking
alcoholism, the physician may bless the efforts of tee-total
advocates, of those engaged in reducing the number
of saloons, of those securing better dietetics and
cooking, less industrial fatigue, or more satisfactory
domestic sleeping accommodation, and of parents and
teachers engaged in promoting self-control in the
young as a habit of life; and he will call them all in
aid of his curative and preventive life work.</p>

<p>So, also in the control of venereal diseases, early
and prompt diagnosis and treatment must go hand in
hand with police measures for the suppression of prostitution,
with educational work respecting these diseases,
and with the inculcation of a higher standard
of morality, considered as part of the general cultivation
of moral self-restraint.</p>

<p>And in the prevention of infant mortality and of the
even more serious handicapping of the up-growing
child produced by the factors of infant mortality, we
need to bring to bear all our medical and hygienic
knowledge, and to realise that until every mother in
the land is furnished with the elementary requirements,
domestic, sanitary, social, and medical, for rearing
a healthy family, we have no right to mental comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
while enjoying these elementary needs of family
life ourselves.</p>

<p>Coöperation and solidarity of effort are needed on
the part of the multitude of workers engaged in social
work for the community—official and non-official; and
in bringing this about the physician of the early future
will, I am confident, take a leading part.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which Health Problems can
be approached: what may be called the microscopic
method, which examines in minute detail each individual
problem; and the conspective method, in which
an attempt is made to obtain an unbiased and comparative
view of the chief problems concerned, in
order that their relative importance may be assessed,
and the possibilities of improvement may be gauged.
In proposing to myself the latter and more difficult
task, I appreciate the impossibility of discussing all
the items which emerge.</p>

<p>I would not have us forget what has already been
achieved. Taking the national figures for England
and Wales as an illustration, it is noteworthy that the
death-rate from all causes fell from 22.4 per 1,000 of
population in 1846-50 to 13.8 in 1911-15, a reduction
of nearly 40 per cent. Comparing the decennium
1871-80 with the quinquennium 1911-15, the incidence
of reduction of death-rate at different ages was
as follows:</p>

<p>The survey is saddened by the terrible losses of War,
and the even more devastating ravages of influenza;
and we realize our inadequacy to prevent catarrhal
infections, until further research into preventive possibilities
proves successful, and until the standard of
universal conduct for catarrhal affections becomes
much higher than at present. We realize furthermore
that probably at least half the deaths from all causes
which occur could be postponed until old age. But the
standard of health of the general population has greatly
improved; typhus has practically disappeared under
peace conditions; yellow fever approaches its demise;
malaria and typhoid are controllable; tuberculosis and
venereal diseases are only waiting for systematic, complete,
and continuous measures to secure their rapid
decline or actual disappearance; the mortality from
childbearing and of young children has greatly declined;
and this is an incomplete statement of what
has already been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>


<h3><em>Obstacles</em></h3>

<p>This improvement is all the more remarkable in
view of the additional obstacles imposed to health improvement
by modern conditions of urban and industrial
life.</p>


<h3><em>Urbanization</em></h3>

<p>The population during the last century has steadily
flocked to the towns from country districts. Streets
have taken the place of green fields; rows of unsatisfactory
dwellings have replaced country cottages; we
have dust and belching smoke and noise instead of
sunshine and country air and quiet; bustle and turmoil
instead of life in close touch with mother-earth: and
this change has been associated with an almost unlimited
inter-communication of human beings, and a corresponding
increase in opportunities for the convection
of germs of disease.</p>

<p>Until the time of the industrial revolution in England
modes of locomotion were little if any more advanced
than among the ancient Egyptians; and disease,
when it travelled at all, travelled by slow and deliberate
stages. Now the infections of the entire world
may be sampled in any one district in the course of a
few weeks. Man has, in fact, reverted from the land-tied
condition involved in agriculture to the migratory
habits of an earlier period of man’s life on the earth.
As Wells has put it: “in every locality ... countless
people are delocalised,” and it is not the least evil of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
urbanization that, in consequence of this, the administration
of local affairs falls too often “into the hands
of that dwindling moiety which sits tight in one place
from the cradle to the grave,” or of persons who have
a financial axe to grind.</p>

<p>The difficulties of water supply, of scavenging, and
of drainage, until they were overcome, have made
towns the inevitable destroyers of mankind. The conditions
of housing are worse in towns than in country
districts, higher rents and less ground space implying
that each family on an average lives in fewer and
more crowded rooms than in rural districts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in towns there is greater difficulty in
securing satisfactory arrangements for the storage of
food, especially milk, and in obtaining fresh milk and
vegetables; and there is the serious disadvantage, especially
for children, that their playgrounds are in streets
instead of the fields, and that the possibilities of deriving
infection from dried expectoration and from fæcal
or other organic contamination in yards and backstreets
as well as directly from other children or adults
are multiplied manifold.</p>

<p>Even more important, town life for the father of a
family generally means an indoor and often a dusty
indoor occupation; the mother not infrequently is also
industrially employed; and these adverse circumstances,
so far as they are allowed to continue, now
affect three-fourths of the population of England and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Wales and probably one-half of that of the United
States.</p>

<p>And yet the death-rate from all causes, and especially
from communicable diseases is steadily declining,
to an even greater extent in urban than in rural communities.</p>

<p>It is but fair to add that the differences between
urban and rural populations tend to decrease; at least
this is so in England; probably the same is true to a
less extent in America. The nominally rural population
is becoming more and more urban in character,
and composed not solely of rustics,—who live in and
by the soil and are altogether more natural in their
habits,—but largely of town-dwellers who only sleep
in country dormitories. But this makes it all the more
remarkable that notwithstanding the multitudinous
circumstances which have tended to increase disease,
the death-rate has been lowered to an amount already
indicated, and life has been prolonged to an extent
which has secured an increase in its average expectation
of 10 or 11 years within the last thirty years.</p>


<h3><em>Industrialism</em></h3>

<p>Considerations of time render it impracticable to
discuss in this address the mischievous influence of
modern industrialism on national health. This influence
runs collaterally with that of urbanization; and
in it in the past can be seen the evil results of overwork,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
of dust inhalation, of chemical poisoning, of
industrial infections including tuberculosis, and of the
general depressing effect of protracted monotonous
work. The evils of industrialism like those of urbanization
are happily being in a large measure counteracted.</p>


<h3><em>Poverty</em></h3>

<p>The problems of industrialism in relation to health
cannot be adequately discussed apart from a consideration
of the remuneration for work, which necessarily
depends on the power of the worker to strike a
satisfactory bargain with his employer, and the extent
to which he can ensure regular employment. If these
conditions cannot be fulfilled, or if the breadwinner is
dead or disabled, poverty results, using this word here
in the sense of inability to provide for the personal and
family essentials of health. And here we are at once
faced with the problem of relation of population to
means of subsistence. Malthus in 1798 advanced the
pessimistic hypothesis that poverty is the inevitable
result of increase of population, which entitles him
to be characterised as the Schopenhauer of Political
Economy, as Schopenhauer was the Malthus of Philosophy.
Without attempting detailed discussion of
Malthus’s hypothesis, it is clear that the wealth of the
population depends upon</p>

<p class="no-indent">1. The amount of food produced,<br>
2. The amount of materials produced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span><br>
3. The efficiency in preparation of these materials, and<br>
4. Convenience of transport.<br>
</p>

<p>In all these particulars means of subsistence, considered
internationally, have during the last century
grown more rapidly than population; and now, whether
we like it or not, a new element has entered into the
problem in this and several other countries,—voluntary
control of births,—necessitating the estimation of
future growth of population on a radically different
basis from that of the past, and banishing the fear of
poverty as the result of too large a population.</p>

<p>It may even become necessary to adopt some method
of national remission of taxation or subsidisation of
wages in accordance with size of the family, not only
in France, but hereafter in England, if in England, as
already in France, the voluntary control of births is
practised to an extent resulting in a stationary or even
a decreasing population. In America the possible need
for such action will not arise for several generations,
during which, however, unless the present trend of
events is changed, Roman Catholics appear likely
largely to replace Protestants, and the Slavonic and
Irish to preponderate over the Anglo-Saxon elements
of the population. It is possible, of course, that in
another generation the Roman Catholic Church may
not be able to continue its ban on birth-control, and
that the more “backward” (?) races will adopt similar
devices, including even the Japanese and the
Chinese.</p>

<h3><em>The Malthusian Hypothesis</em></h3>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The Malthusian hypothesis has been held to
justify <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">the laissez faire, laissez aller</i> policy which held
the industrial world in its malignant grip during the
latter part of the eighteenth and the earlier part of the
nineteenth century, and from which we are not yet
completely freed. Workers were exploited and reduced
to a position of modified slavery; and this was
assumed by clergy and political economists alike to be
part of the ordered course of life. This doctrine was
made to support the belief that God had ordained the
poor man’s lot, with its attendant misery and hopelessness.</p>

<p>On page 438 of the sixth edition of his book Malthus
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">that the principal and most permanent cause of poverty has
little or no direct relation to forms of government, or the
unequal division of property; and that, as the rich do not in
reality possess the power of finding employment and maintenance
for the poor, the poor cannot in the nature of things,
possess the right to demand them, are important truths flowing
from the principle of population.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first edition of his book a more extreme,
plainer statement of the position, as assumed by
Malthus, was given, but was omitted from later editions
(the extract is translated by Beale from a French
edition):</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>A man born into the world already occupied, if his family
can no longer keep him, or if society cannot utilise his work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
has not the least right whatever to claim any share of food,
and he is already one too many upon the earth. At the great
banquet of Nature there is no cover laid for him. Nature
commands him to go and she is not long in putting this order
herself into execution.</p>
</div>

<p>Malthus supplied the clue which helped to start Darwin
on his epoch-making investigations; and to the
present day there are men who do not appreciate that
the mutual aid which is fundamental in human society
is an enemy to the continued operation of natural selection,
and that we cannot revert to natural selection
without destroying the characteristic work of civilization.
To think otherwise is the secret behind German
aggression; to act otherwise is to revert to barbarism.
Man has definitely replaced natural by rational selection,
and will, I have no doubt, to a steadily increasing
extent replace competition by coöperation.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The Malthusian hypothesis and the policy based
on it ignored the human element in industry. Happily
revolt against the strict application of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez
faire</i> policy set in soon after urbanization and industrialism
(under the then conditions) began their maleficient
work, first in regard to children, then for
women, and latterly more general in character.</p>

<p>Nothing is more conspicuous in recent years than
the growth of sensibility on the subject of economic
evils, especially as to the conditions of industry. Economic
efficiency, as a sole object, appeared to preclude
regard to morality of method, and the result has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
poverty for the masses of mankind. If this is to cease,
satisfactory minimum standards of comfort and welfare
for the entire population must be accepted, which
will form a first charge on industry. This can only be
hoped for when there is complete practical acceptance
of the fact that “we are members one of another,” and
servitude is completely replaced by the ideal of mutual
service.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The Malthusian hypothesis ignores the great
though paradoxical truth, that although under circumstances
permitting malnutrition and defective training,
large families spell poverty, especially when population
is not distributed where it is needed, the real
wealth of the world after all depends on man himself.
Nature gives him little that he can use in the form in
which he finds it. It is by him and by him alone that
“wealth” is created by converting useless into useful
matter.</p>

<p>It appears to me clear that over-population need not
excite apprehension; that population in itself is the
only means by which national wealth can materialise;
and that our chief aim in securing national efficiency
must be to train each unit of the population adequately
for work, and to prevent the terrible loss of efficiency
due to avoidable sickness.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the direct statement of the
truism that health progress can only be secured by
preventing preventible illness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>Poverty and disease are allied in the closest relationship;
and while it is true that the removal of poverty
would effect a great improvement in national health,
it is even truer that the prevention of illness forms the
most important means for the avoidance of poverty.</p>

<p>In various reports it has recently been shown that
in a number of districts an inverse correlation exists
between infant mortality and the amount of the family
income; the implication appearing to be that increase
of the lower income is the best and perhaps the only
method for obviating excessive loss of infantile life.</p>

<p>In such an argument poverty evidently is considered
as an element, instead of as a highly complex
phenomenon needing to be further analyzed into its
constituent parts. In the instance quoted, the fact
that the correlation between poverty and high infant
mortality is not essential can be shown by examples
of low infant mortality in communities in which poverty
is the rule; by examples of high infant mortality
in which wages are high; and by other examples of
communities in which high infant mortality has been
lowered without any change in economic conditions.</p>

<p>The social conscience cannot be satisfied until every
family has an income sufficing for all its essential
needs; but there are possibilities of successful attack
on infant mortality which can be pursued when economic
change is not within reach, and when such economic
change would not obviate the need for further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
measures. Among such measures may be mentioned
the abolition of alcoholism, the provision of a pure
and adequate milk-supply, increased attention to domestic
and municipal sanitation, health teaching by
public health nurses, and prompt and adequate medical
and nursing assistance when required.</p>


<h3><em>Ignorance</em></h3>

<p>It may have surprised you that I have not placed
ignorance in the forefront, before industrialism, urbanization,
and poverty, as the chief enemy of personal
and public health. I have no hesitation in
making the statement that although there is need for
large additions to present educational work in hygiene,
the utilisation of existing knowledge by those holding
responsible positions is even more important. Is it
not true that it is easier to promote educational
“drives” for any single branch of health education,
than to obtain money for the actual execution of health
work?</p>

<p>Let us look more critically at educational work in
hygiene. Whose ignorance is it proposed to enlighten?
Ignorance is common to all classes, and it is fundamentally
important that systematic instruction in physiology
and hygiene should be given in all our schools;
and that especially every teacher should have adequate
training in these subjects, and in the recognition of the
common mental and physical defects of children. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
a course of instruction were given for all, approaching
that which is given for public health nurses at Yale
University, how much more hopeful would be the
prospect of public health progress, both in New and
Old England. But this does not cover the entire
needs of the case. Consider, for instance, the relation
of maternal ignorance to excessive child mortality.</p>

<p>Maternal ignorance is sometimes regarded as a chief
factor in the causation of excessive child mortality.
It is a comfortable doctrine for the well-to-do person
to adopt; and it goes far to relieve his conscience in
the contemplation of excessive suffering and mortality
among the poor.</p>

<p>This doctrine has found favour in occasional official
reports and in miscellaneous addresses. It embodies
an aspect of truth, but it is mischievous when it implies,
as it sometimes does, that what is chiefly required
is the distribution of leaflets of advice, or the
giving of theoretical instruction as to matters of personal
hygiene.</p>

<p>There is little reason to believe that the average
ignorance in matters of health of the working-class
mother is much greater than that of mothers in other
classes of society. Furthermore, it would appear that
working-class mothers give their infants the supremely
important initial start of breast feeding in a larger
proportion of cases than do the mothers in other stations
of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The mothers in both classes may be ignorant; in
both there is deficient training in habits of observation,
especially in regard to the beginnings of illness; but
the mother in comfortable circumstances is able to
ensure for her infant certain advantages which the
infant of the poorer mother often cannot obtain.
What are these?</p>

<p>1. The well-to-do mother is commonly able to devote
herself to her infant and have assistance in this
duty; the working class mother is single-handed, and
has also to perform, unaided, all the duties of her
household, including the washing and cooking for her
husband and herself and possibly for several children.</p>

<p>2. The well-to-do mother is commonly able to ensure
that the milk for her infant is purchased under
the best circumstances, is stored in a satisfactory pantry,
and is prepared under cleanly conditions. The
working-class mother often is supplied with stale, impoverished
milk, may have no pantry, and, except
when suckling her infant, is handicapped at every
stage in the cleanly preparation of her infant’s food.</p>

<p>3. If the well-to-do mother is ill, adequate medical
and nursing assistance is at once available, and the
child’s welfare can be safeguarded; if the working-class
mother is ill, the child usually must suffer with
its mother.</p>

<p>4. If the child of the well-to-do mother falls ill,
everything that good nursing and medical attendance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
can furnish is commonly at once available; for the
child of the working-class mother the state of matters
is remote from the ideal. Facilities for obtaining
medical attendance and nursing vary greatly in different
districts; but in none are they satisfactory for
the poor, and especially for the classes who have
limited incomes, but do not as a rule receive skilled
hospital treatment, or avail themselves of help from
nursing associations. Prompt medical assistance at
home commonly cannot be afforded for children of
wage-earners, and particularly not for the children of
unskilled workers.</p>

<p>5. Infants and nursing mothers are very rapidly influenced
by their environment. This environment is
complex. The mother is the main element in the environment
of the infant. If she is overworked and
suffers from chronic fatigue her infant must suffer;
directly, because the mother’s milk under these circumstances
is liable to be scanty or impoverished or
otherwise unwholesome; or indirectly, owing to her
being unable to give sufficient attention to her infant.
The infant of the well-to-do mother is less likely to
suffer in either of these ways.</p>

<p>6. Not only are the milk supply, and the storage and
preparation of artificial food, important parts of the
environment of the infant, but so also are the housing
conditions of the family, and the sanitary conditions
of the back-yard and of the street in which the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
is situate. The superiority of the circumstances of
the one mother and infant over those of the other in
these respects is obvious.</p>

<p>There is no reason to assume that the one mother is
more ignorant than the other. But the ignorance of
the working-class mother is dangerous, because it is
associated with relative social helplessness. To remedy
this what is needed is that the environment of the
infant of the poor shall be levelled up towards that of
the infant of the well-to-do, and that medical advice
and nursing assistance shall be made available for the
poor as promptly as it is for persons of higher social
status.</p>

<p>The assistance given will include advice, but it will
be the advice which a medical practitioner gives to his
patient; which a health visitor or public health nurse
gives as to personal hygiene; and which a sanitary inspector
gives to a householder. It should include also
the advice given by a trained midwife or midwifery
nurse, who is in a favourable position to secure the
adoption of her advice by the mother. Such advice is
becoming available to a steadily increasing extent, but
in some industrial towns a majority of midwives and
midwifery nurses are still untrained women, who are
not competent to give the best advice.</p>

<p>I would not have it assumed that I do not attach
high values to the teaching which the physician gives
to his patient and the public health nurse to the healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
mother and infant; but unless this is combined with
assistance to provide the necessary means to health,
whether this be hospital treatment, home nursing, pure
milk, improved domestic conditions, or help to the
over-tired mother, the advice falls far short of its
potentialities for good.</p>

<p>There is need for further instruction of the public
in all branches of hygiene; and we need, if we are
to be efficient in social work, to follow the advice of
Oliver Wendell Holmes, to remove the intellectual
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrana nictitans</i> from our eyes, and to consider the
physical and moral as well as the intellectual obstacles
to health.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of communal health</p>


<h3><em>Defects of Character</em></h3>

<p class="no-indent">are even more pernicious than lack of knowledge. No
member of any of our local authorities can fail to
have been warned that typhoid fever is still being
spread in many communities by impure water, and as
the result of inadequate hospital isolation of cases.
The means of prevention of tuberculosis are well
known; but how few local authorities will face the
problem of supplying adequate funds for clinics, for
examination of contacts, for hospitals for bed-ridden
cases, and for convalescent homes; and how few are
willing to give help to ensure that the consumptive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
patient has a separate bedroom? In how few instances
are the regulations against indiscriminate expectoration
enforced, and how seldom are physicians
called to account for not obeying the law as to prompt
notification of cases of tuberculosis? Will all the
“drives” against tuberculosis effectually remedy this
condition of things? Would not public opinion amply
support <em>the one “drive” which, above all others, is
necessary</em>: a systematized effort on the part of all social
workers to exact a definite promise from every
candidate for local or state office that he will give
earnest support to all well-considered anti-tuberculosis
measures, for the diminution of venereal diseases, for
improving the welfare of mothers and their children,
for promoting school hygiene, and for improving the
housing of the poor. Democratic Government, alas!
hitherto, has meant government by active minorities.
The great danger of democracy is that the minority
may and often does consist largely of persons having
a mercenary interest in the machinery of local government.
Why should not it become an active and
preponderant minority of health gospellers? This
will involve the taking of infinite trouble to overcome
the multiform activities associated with “political
pull”; it will involve the watching of the record of
each elected person, merciless exposure of those who
do not whole-heartedly support reforms, and systematic
effort to prevent the reëlection of all whose record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
proves unsatisfactory. Are we equal to this task? Is
our national and local patriotism equal to this heroic
test, involving most prosaic work, the surveillance and
the “besting” of the politician? If not, our indirect
attack on the enemy by means of special educational
drives can have relatively little effect. Where the
enemy is, there our fight should be; and the chief enemies
of health are local authorities possessing powers
to secure health for the community, who corruptly or
parsimoniously refrain from their duty. Nor can we
avoid responsibility, or the need for strenuous effort
after efficiency by not taking part in official or voluntary
administrative work. We may have sufficiently
good reasons for this abstinence; and onlookers have
their rôle in life. If all were authors, where would
be the readers? There are many indifferent writers
who would be appreciative readers, and the same remark
applies in local administration. Appreciation is
necessary as well as a subject to be appreciated; and
the onlooker at social work may be most helpful. If
he is to be helpful he must be kindly and charitable, as
well as watchful. Rancorous and ill-informed criticism
must be avoided, and the onlooker must be ready
to do justice to good work, or attempted good work.
Nothing has made it so difficult to secure good men to
undertake the burden of local government as the undiscriminating
and uncharitable criticism aimed at
those engaged in it. Criticism of representatives has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
often been deserved; but critics are too often those
who will not aid to the slightest extent in the work
which, often without sufficient knowledge of the facts,
they vilify. When we read of administrative scandals,
it is desirable to have a sense of proportion, and
to remember, as the reader of old records or even of
Pepys’ diary will scarcely need to be reminded, that
corruption was rampant in the past, and especially to
remember that the best way to remove that most subtle
and mischievous form of corruption which consists in
giving and accepting appointments as political rewards,
is by ourselves taking a part in local government,
or by steadily upholding those who are doing so
with integrity.</p>

<p>The onlooker, then, has his duty to perform as well
as the administrator. He cannot do his duty unless
he intelligently studies local administration, even
though he takes no part in it. A chief need is this interested
study of the phases of local administration
by the general inhabitants of each district. Happily
there are indications of the increasing local patriotism
which such study implies. The exact knowledge thus
acquired is the best means of neutralising much of
the ill-natured, because ill-informed, criticism with
which the founts of local administration are too often
fouled. A high moral ideal on the part of onlookers
as well as of administrators is needed if we are to
secure that high standard of social efficiency which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
an indispensable condition of the further triumphs of
preventive medicine now waiting to be secured.</p>


<h3><em>Ideals</em></h3>

<p>In my discussion of the difficulties of health progress,
I have evidently encroached here and there on the second
division of my lay sermon. Let me now attempt
to state more systematically some ideals of health and
means for their realisation.</p>

<p>Intelligent human society, permeated more than we
realise by the essentials of Christianity, has already
gone far in securing remedies, notwithstanding the too
frequent other-worldliness or lack of vision of those
who should have been foremost in rebuilding Jerusalem
in this green and pleasant land. Industrialism
no sooner huddled together labourers and their families
in the courts and alleys of insanitary towns and
overworked them for scanty wages, than the voices of
such philanthropists as Percival, Oastler, Shaftesbury,
Owen, and of many others were heard in favour of
interference with that freedom (!) of contract between
workers and employers, which the professors
of the dismal science regarded as a fundamental principle
in political economy. And so gradually, too
slowly, regulated industry, improved sanitation, better
housing, the isolation and hospitalisation of infectious
cases, the readier access than in rural districts of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
sick to skilled treatment, higher wages, better food
began to counteract the evils of industrialism and
urbanization. Communal action was taken in the
regulation of industry, in the promotion of sanitation,
in providing elementary education; and the result is
seen in the remarkable fact that, notwithstanding its
enormous handicap, urban life has become almost as
safe as rural life, so far as life itself is concerned,
though not in standard of health.</p>

<p>The first lesson, then, which has already been partially
learnt, is that <em>no member of a community can
live to himself</em>. We now believe in the solidarity of
society; that the sores of one section of it means peril
for all. And we are gradually learning to appreciate
that this is true not only in respect of the acute infectious
diseases, and of chronic infectious diseases, such
as tuberculosis and syphilis, but of every disease and
of every other factor in life which causes individual
inefficiency, and which consequently inflicts additional
burdens on the competent section of the community.
I do not wish to underestimate the basic self-centredness,
if not actual selfishness, which, to a varying extent,
is part of the nature of all of us; but in industrial,
as in other social problems, whatever may be the intermediate
turmoil and misunderstandings and disturbance
which appear to loom so threateningly, it is plain
that the mere cash nexus of relationship is becoming
more and more entangled in a moral nexus; and that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
prophet’s vision is scarcely needed to forecast a future
of consolidation and conformity of efforts of employers
and employed such as has never yet been generally
realised. In such a consolidation the idea of servitude
will disappear, and mutual service will take its place.
This will happen by the growth of an idealistic standpoint;
even more, perhaps through motives of community
self-defence.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Great War, though the most terrible
calamity to humanity of the ages, has brought out a
most comforting and elevating thought. <em>Our brothers
and our sons</em>,—and our daughters also in a multitude
of munition and other works,—have proved that, under
the overwhelming moral compulsion of national need,
they <em>are willing and ready to lay down their lives for
great impersonal things</em>, and in their hundreds of thousands
they have done so. Coincidently with this, a
great impetus has been given to work for the health
and welfare of the civilian population, and especially
of mothers and their children. The removable horrors
and losses of peace, in the aggregate, are greater than
those of war. Cannot an equal spirit of sacrifice be
induced against these? Is it not possible to evoke a
like devotion to secure the triumph of good over evil,
of clean administration over political pull, of fair dealing
over industrial exploitation, of adequate output
over “slacking,” of determination to spend and be
spent to secure the welfare of all, in peace as in war?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Thirdly, prior to the war, for years, many among us
had been realising to an increasing extent the supreme
importance of the Mother and the Child, in safeguarding
family life, and in securing the beginnings of personal
and national health. In past years medical officers
of health have been busily occupied in struggling
to overcome epidemic diseases, and in attacking the
circumstances favouring their prevalence. But for
twenty years, at least, the outlook has widened; the
physiological as well as the pathological aspects of
hygiene have received attention; and it has been realised,
more and more, that in the conservation and
upbuilding of the health of the infant and the pre-school
child rests the chief hope of the future; and
somewhat more recently, public health policy has directed
itself to the protection of motherhood, on which
depends essentially the welfare of the child.</p>

<p>This can only be done by ensuring, chiefly through
its mother, <em>for every newcomer on the stage of life, in
all essential points, a footing of equality of opportunity,
physical, mental, and moral, with all others</em>.</p>

<p>The ideal that every child should have equality of
opportunity is really part of a general upward movement
in our national ethical life.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>The thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.</p>
</div>

<p>We begin to appreciate the full significance of the
older words, “it is not the will of your Father that one
of these little ones should perish”; and this ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
happily is now certain to replace the materialistic doctrine
of the German type which drives the weaker to
the wall.</p>

<p>Progress has been slow; but when we recall how
true it was in St. Paul’s day that “the whole creation
groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now”;
and how gradually through the ages the mass of human
suffering has been abated, we can, while regretting
the slow rate of progress, gain encouragement for
more rapid future advance. The abolition of slavery,
the higher position of women, the steadily increasing
force leading towards one standard of sexual morality
for both sexes, the improved conditions of housing and
sanitation notwithstanding the impediments of urban
life, and the increasingly humanitarian conditions of
modern industrialism, all give us reason to lift up our
hearts.</p>

<p>There have been three stages in the attitude of mankind
to altruistic work. The first of these is illustrated
by the attitude of the father who said to his
son: “Learn, my son, to bear tranquilly the calamities
of others.” Is not the second stage, illustrated by the
sleeping disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane, ignorant
or regardless of the impending tragedy; while
the third stage is manifest in the thousands of earnest
social workers,—and the supremely important conscientious
members of our governing bodies come in this
group,—who are endeavouring to secure the realisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
in communal practice of every measure for uplifting
mankind.</p>

<p>It is well for mankind that the Mother and the
Child have become the foundation on which, more and
more, we expect health progress to be built.</p>

</div>
<p class="right fs80">(Wordsworth.)</p>

<p class="no-indent">The history of the Mother and Child summarises the
history of the uplifting of mankind: and although
there are not lacking sinister elements in the present
position, it is a great gain that both in regard to the
Mother and Child and to the saving of life and improvement
of national health generally, we are beginning
to realise that this is not merely a question of
self-interest, personal or national; but that we are concerned
also with duty, and honour, and chivalry.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">Some Aspects of Poverty</span>
<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>I use the word Poverty, for the purpose of this discussion,
as meaning Destitution, in the sense of lack
of means to provide some specific requirement, indispensable
for the health of the family, or the individual.</p>

<p>Such poverty is evidently undesirable and mischievous,
from the point of view of both rich and
poor; and I think we shall agree that, given the adoption
of the requisite measures, its continuance in most
instances is unnecessary. Hence the real subject for
discussion is, how poverty may be diminished and
prevented.</p>

<p>I do not propose to touch on the important subjects
of unemployment, of under-employment, or of the relation
between the size of family and poverty, though
the last named of these opens up an interesting subject
of discussion. (On this see page <a href="#Page_164">164</a>.) I shall confine
my remarks to the very obvious relation between poverty
and sickness, and to the neglect to act on our
present knowledge, which if acted on would in a short
time lead to a great reduction of poverty in our midst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>There is much truth in each of the statements that
poverty is responsible for much disease, that disease is
responsible for the greater part of the total poverty in
our midst, and that poverty begets poverty.</p>

<p>Poverty and disease are allied by the closest bonds,
and nothing can be simpler or more certain than the
statement that the removal of poverty would effect an
enormous reduction of disease. The removal of poverty
must, therefore, be in itself an object always fascinating
to those whose study is the public health.
The diseases which would be reduced by this means,
include not merely those which physicians treat, but
many moral diseases which persist because they are
only to be avoided by the poor through the exercise of
discipline and self-restraint far beyond what is practised
by the average person in classes not subject to
poverty. The happiness of a community being in itself
a desirable object, a national asset, it is also not
irrelevant to consider that the removal of poverty
involves enlarged opportunities for enjoyment which,
rightly directed, would be only of less value than the
removal of disease. It is not surprising, therefore,
that the first impulse of a student of the public well-being,
in which the public health is the most important
factor, is to attack disease by demanding the reduction
of poverty, with its more or less inevitable accompaniments
of over-fatigue, privation, overcrowding, and
dirt. And it must be freely admitted that when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
most active public health administration, including
adequate medical aid for the sick, has attained its utmost
efficiency, and has in every respect done all that
it can to reduce disease, there will still remain a cruel
residuum which can be attacked in no other way than
by the removal of poverty, or by the removal from
poverty of the elements of personal privation which
affect the public health.</p>

<p>The importance attached to poverty as a cause of
illness and mortality is illustrated in reports on local
investigations, displaying an inverse relationship in
different communities between family income and the
rate of infant mortality, the reader being left to infer,
that increase of the lower incomes is the one method
for obviating excessive loss of infantile life. In suggesting
this crude generalization it is evident that poverty
is being regarded as an element, instead of as a
highly complex phenomenon, which needs to be further
analysed into its constituent parts. The crude generalised
statement as to the relation between excessive
mortality and poverty, furthermore, fails to bring out
three essential points, viz., that infant mortality may
be very low in communities in which poverty is the
rule; that it may be high in the absence of poverty;
and that where infant mortality is high, it can be
greatly reduced without change of economic conditions.</p>

<p>There should be an adequate family income for
every family; and the social conscience cannot be satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
until this is realised. But, in seeking for practical
reform we must appreciate that a large share of
the disease and of the inefficiency of the individual and
family associated with poverty can be remedied otherwise
than by an increase of the family income. This
is shown by national and international experience.
The death-toll on infant life is very much lower in
Norway and in Ireland—both relatively poor countries—than
in England. Poverty in these instances
evidently has less weight than the favorable factors
of rural life and natural feeding. A like discrepancy
in experience of infant mortality is seen between the
experience of towns, and of wards in the same town,
with approximate equality as regards poverty. Similarly
in England the infants of miners with relatively
high wages suffer a higher mortality (160 per 1,000
births in 1911) than the infants of textile operatives
(148) with relatively low wages; while the latter suffer
more than the infants of agricultural labourers (97).
These instances at once suggest that some conditions
in town life play an important part in causing excessive
infant mortality; that in towns insanitary conditions
and habits of life are even more injurious than the
absence from home of the industrially employed
mother; and that the causation of infant mortality is
complex, and its prevention necessitates a multifarious
attack on social and industrial evils, the character of
this attack necessarily varying in different localities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in accordance with the incidence of these evils. That
the influence of urban life in causing excessive mortality
can be counteracted is shown by the varying
mortality in different urban communities, and in different
parts of the same town.</p>

<p>We may in a given instance be totally unable to increase
the family income; but the family’s present expenditure
may be more satisfactorily distributed; and
some, at least, of the constituent elements of poverty
producing excessive child mortality can be obviated.
We know, indeed, that this can be done. The fact
that in the United States no part of the family income
can be spent on alcoholic drinks, implies the removal
from multitudes of families of the demoralising influences
associated with alcoholism, which are unfavourable
to the health of adults and children alike.</p>

<p>Similarly, increased attention to domestic and municipal
sanitation and to the provision of a pure and
adequate milk supply, the health teaching given by
public health nurses, and the prompt medical and hygienic
guidance at Child Welfare Centres are having
an important influence in the same direction. Work
on these medical and sanitary lines, for both adults
and children, comes legitimately within the sphere of
the work of Public Health Authorities, provided out
of rates and taxes.</p>

<p>It may be urged that such provision, after all, means
supplementation of the family income at the public expense.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
It is more properly to be regarded as a measure
of insurance against contingencies by which every
member of the community is benefited; for we are
each and all concerned in the efficiency of every other
member of the community. We are members one of
another. The objection stated above has no greater
validity than an argument similarly advanced against
the provision of police protection or of sanitary measures
out of public funds.</p>

<p>Elementary, and to some extent secondary and university,
education are regarded as not only the legitimate
subjects of communal provision, but also as incapable
of being provided satisfactorily by each individual
family; and this view applies with even greater
force to the provision of hospitals and expert medical
assistance, of nursing assistance, and of such additional
occasional domestic service as is required to
maintain the functional integrity of the family.</p>

<p>I have given the above as a special instance of the
contention that poverty is a complex, including a number
of elements, and that it is our duty to ascertain in
each area by careful local inquiry what are these constituent
elements, and if practicable their relative
weight; and then to apply the most urgently needed
remedies, not contenting ourselves with the relatively
useless generalisation that the evils we see are ascribable
to poverty.</p>

<p>I lay special stress on the provision of skilled medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
advice and treatment, and of nursing assistance
at the public expense, which at present are sorely deficient
for the vast majority of the population, and perhaps
for none more so than for the less well-to-do
people who receive salaries and not weekly wages.
This assistance possesses the special advantage previously
pointed out, that it does not tend to create a demand
for further assistance, when such assistance is
not required.</p>

<p>The greatest bulk of poverty is due directly to sickness.
A vast mass of sickness still occurs, which is
not owing to lack of family or communal means, but
is due to ignorance or neglect on the part of the individual,
of the responsible owners of houses, of the
employers of work-people, and still more of the members
of local authorities or state legislatures. Typhoid
fever still commonly prevails as the result of neglected
sanitation; hookworm disease still causes incapacity
of hundreds of thousands for the same reason; malaria,
still one of the greatest scourges of humanity,
might be reduced to a fraction of its present amount
if each community and each person would carry out
available simple preventive measures; tuberculosis is
still spread throughout every civilized community
chiefly because indiscriminate expectoration is unregulated,
and satisfactory and acceptable hospital treatment
is not provided for all those who need it. And
so we continue to allow avoidable poverty to be perpetuated,
and to impose not only on the sick poor themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
but also on the efficient and solvent part of the
community a heavy burden, the removal of which
would, to an almost incredible extent, increase the
general happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>The relief of poverty is at the best an inefficient and
expensive remedy. It is seldom adequate, and it has
few preventive elements. The prevention of poverty
by prevention of the illness causing it, and by early
and satisfactory treatment of such illness as fails to
be prevented is the only efficient, as well as in the long
run the only economical plan of campaign. Money insurance
against sickness has its place as a means of
alleviating the results of poverty. But it is not an aid
to its prevention; under any existing system of insurance
the money payment is insufficient and definitely
limited in duration. Although such relief is useful,
it is totally unsatisfactory when not linked up with a
complete system of hygienic measures, and when not
associated with adequate medical treatment and nursing.
For the linking of treatment provided largely
out of public funds with insurance there is no justification,
and it is contrary to the public interest; and
it is unfortunate that monetary insurance has been
provided in England for a section of the population
under these unsatisfactory conditions, thus diverting
expenditure from the public health services in which
it was urgently needed, and in which its use would at
once have been fruitful in increased health and happiness.</p>

for its Control in England</span><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>My task is to attempt to give a bird’s-eye view of
“The Methods of Controlling Tuberculosis in England,”
and to revaluate, as far as is practicable, in the
light of many years’ study of the disease, the relative
value of the measures which historically have been
followed by the greatly reduced mortality from tuberculosis.
The subject teems with difficulties, and as
you are aware there is no unanimity of opinion when
tuberculosis is thus considered. This is the more surprising
in view of our present accurate knowledge of
the pathology of disease caused by bovine and human
tubercle bacilli, and in view of the fairly general unanimity
of opinion as to the methods of control which
are needed to secure still more rapid reduction of the
devastations of tuberculosis. This general opinion
may, I think, be summarised in the statement which I
have made elsewhere, that the removal or diminution
of infection from each single case of tuberculosis
reduces correspondingly the prospect of further cases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
but that tuberculosis will not be completely controlled
until every tuberculous patient receives such care
throughout the whole course of his life, as will ensure
his welfare and will obviate the likelihood of his infecting
others.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the English death-rate from
pulmonary tuberculosis—which is responsible for 71
per cent. of the total mortality from tuberculosis, and
which is practically always due to infection from a
human source,—declined in males between 1871-75
and 1876-80 by 7.2 per cent.; in the next quinquennium
by 9.8 per cent.; between 1881-85 and 1886-90
by 8.3 per cent.; in the next quinquennium by 9.5 per
cent.; between 1896-1900 and 1901-05 by 7 per cent.;
and between 1901-06 and 1906-10 by 9.7 per cent.
Evidently a large share of the reduction of the death-rate
from phthisis occurred before it was generally regarded
as an infectious disease, and before sanatoria
were in existence for its treatment. It should be
added that since the possibilities of infection have been
realised and the need for treatment of the disease has
been appreciated, there has in no part of the world,
so far as I am aware, been an adequate application of
known methods of prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>We must look elsewhere, therefore, than to intentional
measures directed against tuberculosis for an
explanation of its decline during the period before
Koch discovered the tubercle bacilli and before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
significance of this discovery was appreciated; and
attempt to appreciate the relative value of the factors
of decline operating before and since our outlook on
the disease was fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>Certain facts stand out beyond controversy, and
on these administrative control must necessarily be
based.</p>


<h3><em>Basic Facts as to Tuberculosis</em></h3>

<p>1. Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease with
a low degree of infectivity. Circumstances favouring
infection have a high degree of importance; but tuberculosis
does not develop in the absence of the tubercle
bacillus. No infection, no disease.</p>

<p>2. Tuberculosis may remain latent in the system for
many years, and there is strong reason for thinking
that the infection of a large proportion of early adult
tuberculosis was acquired in childhood.</p>

<p>3. The two types of tubercle bacilli, bovine and human,
are stable both in character and in degree of
virulence, and are not interchangeable so far as can
be shown by protracted experimentation. The human
type of bacillus is the chief source of infection of
mankind, though bovine infection is not negligible.</p>

<p>Out of 98 children between the age of 2 and 10 years
who had died in various hospitals from all causes unselected,
18 or 18.4 per cent. were found to have been
infected by tubercle bacilli of the bovine type, and 81<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
or 81.6 per cent. by tubercle bacilli of the human type.
(Report on Investigations made in the Laboratory of
the Local Government Board, Annual Report of the
Medical Officer of the Local Government Board,
1913-14, p. lix.)</p>

<p>4. Animal experimentation shows that in animals of
the same species the extent of tuberculosis produced
depends to a large and probably to a dominant extent
on the number of tubercle bacilli introduced into the
system. Although doubtless there are variations in
susceptibility in families, and in each individual at different
periods, there is little doubt that in the main
the same rule holds good for mankind.</p>

<p>5. Experience shows that dusty occupations, indoor
occupations, alcoholism, over-fatigue, an attack of
acute illness, especially of influenza, measles, or enteric
fever, increase the danger of minimal doses of tubercle
bacilli, and serve to bring latent foci of disease into
activity.</p>


<h3><em>Explanations of the Decreasing Death-rate from Tuberculosis</em></h3>

<p>In the light of the above facts, how is the steady
and continuous decline in the death-rate from tuberculosis
during the last fifty years to be explained?</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) No support is given by animal experiment to
the assumption that the types of human bacillus infecting
mankind have declined in virulence; and changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in the severity of consumption historically or currently
in different races of mankind are equally explicable on
the ground of differences in social misery, in sanitary
conditions and associated heavier dosage of infection
and neglect of treatment.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The facts do not appear to me to be reconcilable
with the assumption that natural selection has
increased human resistance to infection by tuberculosis;
though, were this so, it would not justify refraining
from every possible effort to control infection and
to treat every tuberculous patient by the best known
methods. Tuberculosis is an ancient disease, there
being evidence of it in Egyptian mummies 1000 years
B.C.; and any selective agency has, therefore, had
ages for its operation. If the steady decline—approximating
2 per cent. per annum in the death-rate from
pulmonary tuberculosis in England during the last
thirty or forty years—has resulted from the acquirement
of racial immunity, it is remarkable that a somewhat
similar decline has occurred almost simultaneously
during the last forty years in Great Britain,
Germany, and America; while in France, Norway,
and Ireland there has been little if any decline, or it
has occurred only in very recent years.</p>

<p>To assume that susceptibility to the tubercle bacillus
in the course of its natural history has diminished in
England, and that Ireland has not shared in this privilege
would be to add one more to Irish grievances!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
This assumption does not fit in with international facts;
which point rather to the conclusion that, during the
period in question, unsatisfactory sanitary and social
circumstances, including opportunities for massive and
protracted infection, have continued to a greater extent
and for a longer time in Ireland and France than in
Great Britain, America and Germany.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) If the assumption of increasing racial immunity
does not consist well with all the facts, more perhaps
can be said in favour of the unproved hypothesis that
a high proportion of the population are from time to
time temporarily immunized by small doses of tubercle
bacilli; and their resistance to larger doses of infection
thereby increased. Experimentally calves inoculated
with small doses of tubercle bacilli remain during the
next year or two unaffected by much larger doses of
tubercle bacilli, unlike calves not submitted to this
treatment. Tubercle bacilli are somewhat widely distributed,
though they occur chiefly in the immediate
environment of careless consumptive patients; and it
is conceivable that minimal doses of bacilli may arouse
the resistance of the cells and fluids of the body and
prepare them to resist successfully larger doses of
infection. This is consistent with the fact that while
one in about ten deaths from all causes is caused by
tuberculosis, a majority of the total population are
shown by pathological evidence to have been at one
time or another infected by tuberculosis, and yet have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
either never been ill, or have recovered, usually without
the existence of tuberculosis being detected or
even suspected. Obviously this is satisfactory evidence
that mankind is relatively resistant to the infection
of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The fact just mentioned naturally leads to the question:
what determines the result when tubercle bacilli
invade the human subject? Assuming fairly uniform
virulence of tubercle bacilli, the result for an infected
person depends on two factors: the dosage of infection,
and the resistance of the cells and fluids of the
invaded person; and evidently increase in the dosage
of infection and lowering of personal resistance may
have identical effect in determining serious disease.
Of the importance of the already mentioned factors
which lower personal resistance to disease,—often also
at the same time increasing infection,—there can be
no doubt.</p>

<p>It is impossible in most instances to set out separately
circumstances increasing infection from circumstances
lowering resistance. During the last three or
four decades there has been improvement in respect
of the factors lowering resistance to attack, but there
has been simultaneously a great decline in opportunities
for infection on a massive scale, as a result of
habits of greater cleanliness, especially in regard to
spitting, of diminished overcrowding of population,
and of increased treatment and the incidental segregation
of advanced cases of disease in hospital beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>


<h3><em>Hospital Treatment of Consumptives</em></h3>

<p>I have seen no reason for revoking the conclusion
expressed in 1908 in a lecture to the Washington International
Congress on Tuberculosis that historically the
hospital treatment and coincident segregation of patients
suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis has been
an important and probably a dominant factor in producing
the national decline in the death-rate from tuberculosis
in the countries in which a decline has been
experienced. This explanation fits in with our knowledge
of the disease, and with the analogous history of
leprosy; and it is supported by the fact that by complete
segregation of infected from non-infected cattle
tuberculosis can be eliminated at will from a herd of
cattle. It is remarkable, as I have elsewhere set out
in much detail, that improved general health, increased
well-being, and sanitary education have operated in
Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Massachusetts
side by side with great decrease in the death-rate
from pulmonary tuberculosis; while up to very
recent years the same influences in France, Norway,
and Ireland have produced little or no decrease in the
national death-rate from tuberculosis. And similarly
no constant relation can be shown between the degree
of sanitary and social well-being in different countries
and cities, and the amount of mortality imposed by
tuberculosis. How is it that in some countries a high
degree of domestic overcrowding is associated with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
low and declining phthisis death-rate and conversely
that a persistently high phthisis death-rate may occur
with a less but still diminishing degree of overcrowding?
The explanation is contained, I maintain, in the
following statement:</p>

<p><em>A given amount of domestic overcrowding with a
large amount of institutional segregation of consumptives
is associated with less tuberculosis than when
overcrowding is less but accompanied by only a small
amount of institutional segregation of consumptives.</em>
The data as to institutional segregation are difficult
to obtain; but there is sufficient evidence to show that
in countries which have experienced a large reduction
in the death-rate from tuberculosis a large proportion
of hospital treatment for many years has been provided
for consumptives, while in countries which have
not experienced this decline such provision has been
absent or imperfect. In London about 56 per cent.,
in county boroughs 35 per cent., in other urban districts
21 per cent., and even in rural districts of England
near 16 per cent. of all deaths from pulmonary
tuberculosis occur in hospitals (poor-law institutions,
general and special hospitals, and asylums). Prior to
the patient’s death he has had on an average at least
three months, and probably in the aggregate more
nearly five or six months, residential treatment, and
this at the stages of disease in which there is the greatest
discharge of infective material, in which owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
feebleness the patient is least able to control its hygienic
disposal, and in which—had the patient been
treated at home—the relatives would be especially
liable to receive massive infection, and would be enfeebled
by overwork and anxiety, or by the malnutrition
associated with poverty.</p>

<p>Some writers have failed to visualize the fact that
the segregation of a minority of the total cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis for a portion of their illness can
have had a marked influence on the prevalence of this
disease. They appear to be judging tuberculosis by
the same measure as they would apply to smallpox,
which in an unprotected community spreads rapidly if
a few cases are overlooked. The case of tuberculosis,
like that of leprosy, is governed by the considerations
that both these diseases as a rule require intimate and
protracted contact for their spread, and that in both
diseases there may be prolonged latency before active
disease develops. A hypothetical illustration may serve
to elucidate the order of magnitude of the influence
exercised by institutional segregation. Let us assume—as
is probably the case in England—that one-fifth of
the cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are treated during
one-third of a year institutionally under conditions in
which they will not be liable to spread infection. Let
us assume further that each of these cases has an infectious
lifetime of three years. Thus one-fifth of the
cases are deprived of their power to spread infection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
during one-ninth of their period of “open” disease.
It being assumed that personal infection causes pulmonary
tuberculosis and that segregation is efficient,
segregation to the extent indicated above should secure
a reduction in the death-rate from pulmonary
tuberculosis of 100/(5 × 9) approximately 2 per cent.</p>

<p>In actual fact the decline in the English death-rate
from pulmonary tuberculosis since 1871 has been at a
rate slightly under 2 per cent. per annum.</p>


<h3><em>Koch’s Endorsement of Segregation View</em></h3>

<p>An extract from an article written by Robert Koch
shortly before his death may be permitted (Epidemiologie
der Tuberkulose Zeitschr. für Hyg. und Infektious
Krankheiten. 4. XVII, 1910).</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>I am entirely in agreement with Newsholme that the allocation
of consumptives to institutions for the sick, as freely
as possible and for as long as possible, is the most active
means of avoiding infection and the consequent spread of
phthisis.</p>

<p>In my experience, too, phthisis has shown the most marked
decline in those places where comprehensive measures have
been taken for bringing consumptives into hospitals, and the
converse has been the case where the converse conditions
prevail. It is indeed obvious that in no other way can the
danger of infection, which a phthisical patient constitutes, be
so effectively removed as by isolation in hospital. Strong
support of this method is afforded by leprosy, where good
results in attacking the disease have been obtained by following
the same principle.</p>

<p>In addition to this factor there is a second, which also
plays a very important part, viz., housing.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>A hypothesis explanatory of a given phenomenon
should be consistent with all the associated facts. We
have seen that the hypothesis that segregation of consumptives
is an important factor in the reduction of
the death-rate from pulmonary tuberculosis agrees (1)
with our knowledge of the tubercle bacillus, and (2)
with veterinary and agricultural experience; also (3)
that,—although exact data are unobtainable,—the degree
of segregation when ascertainable is consistent
with the degree of decline in the death-rate; (4) it is
important to note also that this hypothesis is consistent
with the otherwise anomalous facts that although the
proportion of the population subjected to urban conditions
of life has steadily increased, and the number of
persons per inhabited room remains much greater in
towns than in country districts, the death-rate from
pulmonary tuberculosis in England has declined as
much in them as in country districts; and that notwithstanding
the greater overcrowding in towns, the urban
is rapidly falling to the level of the rural death-rate
from this disease. The town dweller’s better and
more frequent treatment in hospitals is an important
factor in overcoming the handicap of urban conditions
of life, including overcrowding and preponderance of
indoor and dusty occupations.</p>

<p>It is desirable to supplement the above statement by
some remarks on</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>


<h3><em>Improved Housing as a Means of Reducing Tuberculosis</em></h3>

<p>Not infrequently the thoughtless remark is made
that given improved housing sanatoria and hospitals
for consumptives would be unnecessary. The frequent
occurrence of tuberculosis in well-to-do families
shows the absurdity of this statement. It is true that
tuberculosis is more prevalent among the poor living
in small tenements that among the well-to-do; but
there is no consistent proportion between the degree
of overcrowding in different districts or towns and
the death-rate from tuberculosis. Improved housing
and institutional treatment for tuberculosis cannot
properly be regarded as alternatives. They are necessary
complements to each other, and there must be
increased expenditure in both directions, if tuberculosis
is to be more rapidly reduced in amount. There
are in fact two housing problems—for the healthy,
and for the sick. The most rapid method of improving
housing for the healthy is to remove the sick, and
especially the tuberculous sick to a hospital. This is
being done year by year to an increasing extent. In
England and Wales in 1870, 8.3 per cent., and in 1912
21.6 per cent. of all deaths from all causes occurred in
public institutions. It is difficult to exaggerate the
practical relief implied in these figures in respect of
satisfactory housing, especially in its functional aspect.
Apart altogether from the tuberculosis problem much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
of the decline in the general death-rate must be attributed
to the skilled treatment which a large proportion
of the total population have received in our hospitals
of various types.</p>

<p>I may, I think, claim to have answered in part the
question asked at an earlier stage of this address, as
to the causes of the steady decline in the death-rate
from tuberculosis in recent decades. I do not claim
that any one factor has brought about this result. I
do not claim that it has been caused entirely by diminution
of opportunities of infection; but I deprecate
the view that improved nutrition and other conditions
diminishing susceptibility have played a predominant
part. The facts of international hygienic history rebut
this view. Although segregation of patients in
institutions has played a great part in bringing about
the result, diminution of domestic infection as the
result of more cleanly habits has doubtless had an important
influence; as has also the reduction of industrial
dust.</p>

<p>It is significant that general hygiene and improved
care of the sick—quite apart from any intention to
segregate—were associated with a large reduction in
the death-rate from tuberculosis before the importance
of reducing infection was fully appreciated; and that
since the necessity for direct measures against tuberculosis
was realised, since such measures have been
begun, however imperfectly, in many countries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
since anti-tuberculosis educational propaganda has
been somewhat active, there has been no increase
in the rapidity of decline of the death-toll of tuberculosis.
Of course, it cannot be seriously—though
it is foolishly—argued from this fact that such direct
measures are futile. Every year there has been increasing
migration of masses of people into towns,
with a corresponding increase of undesirable domestic
overcrowding and of indoor occupations. If, therefore,
such anti-tuberculosis measures as have been
adopted,—whether direct measures or general sanitary
measures,—had been associated with an absence of
decline or with actual increase in the death-rate from
tuberculosis it might still be that these measures have
achieved much. Many conflicting agencies are at
work, and it might well be that the apparent lack of
success of the measures taken is due to the increased
operation of countervailing influences. The importance
of direct action for the control of tuberculosis
must be judged not solely by necessarily imperfect
statistical measurement on the basis of a few years’
observation, but <em>by ascertaining that the proposed
measures are in accord with our knowledge of the natural
history of the disease</em>. As we have seen, both
comparative and human pathology assure us that tuberculosis
is a communicable and therefore a preventible
disease, and point the way to the means for securing
this end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Before describing the direct measures which have
been adopted for the control of tuberculosis, it should
be added that in no country have these been in operation
sufficiently long, and in no country have they been
so adequately applied, as to render it practicable to
apply statistical measurement of their value; meanwhile
these measures must be judged in the light of
our knowledge of the pathology of tuberculosis.</p>


<h3><em>Notification of Tuberculosis</em></h3>

<p>If every tuberculous patient were intelligent, and
willing and able to follow the advice given by his doctor,
if he consulted his doctor for the first symptoms
of illness, if his disease were recognized by the doctor
at its earliest recognizable stage, and if the doctor in
every instance gave the right advice and made the necessary
examinations of all “contacts,” no occasion
would arise for the intervention or assistance of Public
Health Authorities, except in providing bacteriological
facilities and institutional accommodation. In
actual fact these conditions are not secured for the
majority of patients; and the private practitioner,
however willing, is seldom in a position to remedy the
domestic and industrial insanitary conditions which
favour infection and lower resistance to infection.</p>

<p>Hence notification of cases of tuberculosis was advocated
for many years by pioneer medical officers
of health who secured voluntary notification by doctors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
of a considerable proportion of the total cases in
their districts, and in a few instances secured compulsory
notification by local enactment, before any general
regulations on the subject were made. It is noteworthy
that in this early period a town like Brighton,
which had voluntary notification with sanatorium provision
for patients willing thus to be treated, secured
the notification of a larger proportion of total cases
than another town in which notification was compulsory,
but no sanatorium accommodation had been provided.
The point is mentioned as emphasizing the
general principle that compulsory measures in public
health, if they are to be successful, require to be associated
with full provision for the action which should
follow the compulsory enactment; which provision, as
in this case, may be a direct inducement to compliance
with the enactment. In view of the change of central
policy involved and of the unpreparedness of most
local authorities to give the assistance needed for notified
cases, the general enforcement of notification of
tuberculosis was brought about in stages; in 1909
poor-law cases of consumption were made notifiable
throughout England and Wales, hospital cases in 1911,
consumption in the general community in 1912, and all
forms of tuberculosis in 1913.</p>

<p>It was not anticipated that complete notification of
cases would be obtained for some years, but a review of
English national experience of notification of tuberculosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
up to the present time necessitates the confession
that there has been failure to secure the coöperation
of an unexpectedly large proportion of the medical
profession in this public-health duty. Many cases
have never been notified and in a large number of
other cases notification has been belated; Dr. Barwise,
County Medical Officer of Health of Derbyshire, obtained
information as to 417 deaths certified during
1917 to be due to tuberculosis, and found that of this
number 39 per cent. had never been notified, and that
over 70 per cent. had either not been notified or died
within twelve weeks of notification. This may be an
exceptionally bad experience; but the duty of notification
in many areas is only imperfectly performed, and
no adequate steps are being taken to diminish this
default.</p>

<p>As notification is the first step towards coördinated
measures for the patient and in the interest of the
public health, the causes of delay in notification and
of failure to notify deserve further examination.</p>


<h3><em>Causes of Failure in Notification</em></h3>

<p>1. The patient himself commonly is responsible for
much delay in the recognition of his disease. A large
proportion of consumptive patients refrain from applying
for treatment until disease is fully established,
and until they are incapacitated for work. Not infrequently
this means that the patient does not consult a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
doctor until a few months or even weeks before his
death. Until the conditions of general medical practice
are altered, and every person has the right to state-paid
medical consultations, belated recourse to medical
advice will continue.</p>

<p>With this there is badly needed further education of
the public as to seeking advice for protracted colds and
coughs, or for other symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis;
and a wider hygienic propaganda as to housing,
overcrowding, dusty indoor occupations, expectoration,
etc., is also called for.</p>

<p>2. Under present conditions of medical practice,
early diagnosis of tuberculosis often fails to be secured,
even when the patient places himself under
medical care. It is to the private practitioner that
most patients resort, and the early recognition and
treatment of disease depends primarily (<em>a</em>) on his skill,
(<em>b</em>) on his not being so overworked as to be unable to
devote adequate time to the examination of each patient
coming under his care, and (<em>c</em>) on his willingness
to refer doubtful cases for consultation with the official
tuberculosis officer of each area. These officials
have only existed during the last few years; their
work was partially in abeyance during the four and a
half years of war; and apart from this, they have not
always succeeded in persuading the private practitioner
that their coöperation is to be welcomed and
that they are not agents for depriving him of his private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
patients. This assumed antagonism between private
and public medical practice is one of the most
serious difficulties in securing more rapid progress in
anti-tuberculosis work.</p>

<p>3. For nearly every sanitary area gratuitous facilities
are now provided for the examination of sputum
for tubercle bacilli, and yet in many areas there is
grave neglect to utilize this provision, and patients
with chronic phthisis may be treated during long
months or even years for “winter cough,” “bronchitis,”
etc., without adequate physical examination of
sputum. The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis
ought, it is true, to be made before tubercle bacilli are
found in the sputum, and failure to recognize the disease
prior to this implies that the disease has already
become serious; but in fact a very large proportion of
consumptive patients for many months have tubercle
bacilli in their sputum, before the diagnosis of tuberculosis
is made.</p>

<p>4. When, as in some areas, the medical officer of
health or the tuberculosis officer takes little, if any,
useful action after notifications have been received, the
practitioner has an excuse for not notifying subsequent
cases. He can argue with some cogency that
notification has no value <em>per se</em>; its utility depends on
the action which follows on notification. Unless useful
action follows on notification, default in notification
has little practical importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>


<h3><em>Public Health Action Following Notification</em></h3>

<p>Under the English Tuberculosis Regulations the
medical officer of health or an officer of the local authority
acting under his instructions is required to
make such inquiries and take such steps as may be
necessary or desirable for investigating the source of
infection, for preventing the spread of infection, and
for removing conditions favourable to infection. The
action required includes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i></p>

<p>1. Attention to the personal hygiene of the patient,
including instruction in the necessary precautions as
to coughing and expectoration.</p>

<p>2. Any assistance needed to ensure for the patient</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Skilled medical attendance and nursing as required
while he is treated at home;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Institutional treatment when required;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Supplementation of the convalescent patient’s
funds, when needed, to obviate the necessity for him
at once to embark in full-time work; to provide additional
bedroom accommodation when needed; and to
ensure that the patient and his family are not undernourished
or overworked.</p>

<p>3. Remedial action for any insanitary conditions of
the home, such as uncleanliness, dampness, overcrowding;
or of the patient’s workplace, especially for dusty
occupations.</p>

<p>4. Examination of home contacts with the patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>The last named item may conveniently be considered
further at this point.</p>


<h3><em>Examination of Contacts</em></h3>

<p>This branch of tuberculosis work is most important.
Often the first notified case is not the first clinical case
of tuberculosis in a given family; and from the standpoint
of prevention the detection of such cases of
longer standing is important. Examination of contacts
also frequently discovers patients in an earlier
and more curable stage of disease than the notified
patient.</p>

<p>It is important that all home contacts of each notified
case of tuberculosis should be examined; and one
of the most important functions of the tuberculosis
officer is to arrange for this. The examination may
be carried out by arrangement at the tuberculosis dispensary;
but otherwise, at the home of the invaded
family. When there is a medical practitioner in attendance
his coöperation and presence should as a rule
be invited.</p>

<p>Such systematic examination of the household not
only is more efficient in discovering sources of continuing
infection than the desultory examination of a
few contacts,—which often still represents the extent
of this important work,—but it has in addition a
greater educational effect on the public; and general
recourse to such systematic observations would rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
improve the prospect of satisfactory control of
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Even when examination of contacts is practised
after notification of a case of pulmonary tuberculosis,
it is too often neglected after notification of non-pulmonary
cases. This represents a great public-health
loss; the majority of cases of non-pulmonary
tuberculosis are caused by infection of human source,
and this source often is an unrecognized case of pulmonary
tuberculosis in the patient’s family.</p>


<h3><em>Scope of Tuberculosis Schemes</em></h3>

<p>Prior to the general enforcement of notification of
tuberculosis in England excellent local work had been
done in a relatively small number of areas in direct
efforts to control the spread of tuberculosis, in addition
to the previous general measures, such as improved
sanitation, better housing, more satisfactory
nutrition, and especially the hospital treatment of a
large proportion of advanced and acute cases of tuberculosis.
The Report of the last Royal Commission on
Tuberculosis appeared in 1911; and although precautions
against human infection by tuberculous cows’
milk are still very incomplete, the pasteurisation or
boiling of milk is more generally practised than in
the past.</p>

<p>Local Authorities prior to 1911 had power to build
sanatoria or otherwise provide institutional accommodations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
for the treatment of tuberculous patients;
relatively little had been done in most areas. In 1911
the Finance Act provided a sum of £1,116,000 for the
erection of sanatoria in England and Wales, and this,
with money provided by local rates, has led to rapid
increase in accommodation for the residential institutional
treatment of tuberculosis. In England in 1911
local authorities, other than poor-law authorities, had
about 1300 beds for the institutional treatment of tuberculosis,
while there were 4,200 beds in private sanatoria
and voluntary institutions. In 1917 the total
available beds numbered 12,441, of which about one-half
had been provided by local authorities.</p>

<p>In 1911 the National Insurance Act was passed and
came into operation in July, 1912. This provided a
special “Sanatorium Benefit.”</p>

<p>The Departmental Committee appointed to make
recommendations as to detailed direct measures against
tuberculosis, reported in April, 1912, that any scheme
which is to form the basis of an attempt to deal with
the problem of tuberculosis should be available for the
whole community, and that its organization should be
undertaken by the large local authorities (the councils
of counties and county boroughs). These recommendations
were at once adopted by the Government,
which undertook to provide out of the national exchequer
one-half of the net cost of approved local
schemes for the general treatment of tuberculosis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Local authorities were invited at once to prepare
schemes for institutional treatment, residential and
non-residential, domiciliary treatment remaining in the
hands of private practitioners, of poor-law doctors,
and of doctors engaged in the contract work under the
National Insurance Act (“panel doctors”). The
last named are in medical charge of the large mass of
the wage-earners of the community, comprising roughly
one-third of the total population, in so far as their
treatment at home is within the power of a practitioner
of average competence. The schemes proposed
for each area comprised,</p>

<p>1. The appointment of a tuberculosis officer, usually
a whole-time official, who was required to have had
special experience in the diagnosis and treatment of
tuberculosis, and who as a rule was an officer in the
public-health department under the administrative supervision
of the medical officer of health, but independent
in his clinical work;</p>

<p>2. The establishment of tuberculosis dispensaries, at
which patients were treated, consultations as to doubtful
cases held, and contacts examined;</p>

<p>3. The provision of beds in residential institutions
for curable and for acute and advanced cases;</p>

<p>4. The organization of arrangements for “following
up” and “after-care.”</p>

<p>During 1912 and 1913 advance was made in these
directions. In 1911 there were 25-30 tuberculosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
dispensaries: in 1917 their number had increased to
371. In 1914 the onset of the Great War prevented
further development of tuberculosis work and seriously
crippled and reduced the efficiency of work
already initiated; and this increased as the military
demand for medical officers and institutions became
greater. It may be stated generally that in only a
relatively small number of areas have fairly complete
arrangements for the institutional treatment of tuberculosis
come into operation; and that even in these
areas the arrangements have been at work for only a
limited period. It is evident, therefore, as already
pointed out, that no argument as to the utility of these
arrangements can be based on the facts that the death-rate
from tuberculosis has not declined with increased
rapidity in recent years, and that women during the
war, especially at the working years of life have experienced
an increased death-rate from this disease.</p>


<h3><em>Tuberculosis Dispensaries</em></h3>

<p>The tuberculosis officer is the essential element in
the dispensary; and in rural districts he may be said
to carry the dispensary under his hat. The dispensary
if properly organized should serve as the centre
of official anti-tuberculosis measures. The medical
officer of health receives the notifications of recognised
cases whether they are attending the dispensary
or not; and it simplifies administration if the home supervision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
of all tuberculous patients notified to the
medical officer of health, and not only of dispensary
patients, is placed under the supervision of the tuberculosis
officer. At the dispensary itself the tuberculosis
officer examines patients, makes records of their
condition, and of all facts bearing on their welfare,
and recommends the special form of continued treatment
adapted to their condition. This may be domiciliary,
or given at the dispensary, or in a sanatorium,
or in a hospital. A dispensary which does not supervise
and treat a large proportion of the total notified
cases, including especially patients before and after
they have received treatment in a residential institution,
is not fulfilling its possibilities of utility.</p>

<p>At the dispensary is organized also the examination
by the tuberculosis officer of “contacts,” and of school
children suspected to be tuberculous; though it is
often necessary to arrange for this officer to make
similar examinations at patients’ homes. At the dispensary
consultations with private practitioners are
conveniently held; though in this instance also the
tuberculosis officer should arrange when this is desired
for the consultations to be held at the patient’s home.</p>

<p>The dispensary alone cannot ensure the welfare of
the tuberculous patient. It is necessary that the tuberculosis
officer should have consultations concerning
difficult cases with the medical staff of general and
special hospitals. To segregate the treatment of tuberculosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
from that of other diseases means reduced
efficiency of the tuberculosis officers and lowered quality
of treatment.</p>


<h3><em>Tuberculosis Dispensaries should become Parts of General Dispensaries</em></h3>

<p>Public Health and School Authorities have already
established many centres at which hygienic instructions
and medical treatment are given for mothers and
their young children when ailing, or with a view to the
prevention of future illness; for tuberculosis; for
venereal diseases; and for various ailments of school
children.</p>

<p>In England in addition there is poor-law provision
(sometimes at dispensaries) for patients dependent on
official charity. Evidently the multiplicity of authorities,
local and central, concerned in this medical work,
is not conducive to efficiency; and it will, we hope,
soon disappear. Similarly it will be in the interest of
efficiency, as well as of economy, to provide for the
treatment of the above-named groups of cases in a
common Medical Institute for each defined area, at
which also it will be advantageous to arrange for much
of the treatment of insured persons. By this means it
will become practicable to arrange for consultations
between experts in different departments of medicine,
to the advantage of all concerned.</p>

<p>It will be contrary to the communal interest if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
resources of voluntary hospitals in large towns are not
also utilised in official medical work. Many of these
hospitals have specialised departments (e.g., X-ray,
eye, ear, throat, skin, and other special clinics), the
use of which ought to be obtainable, even though for
many years it may not be practicable to arrange for all
hospitals to be financed in part at least out of rates
and taxes.</p>

<p>The tuberculosis officer in order to be able to treat
his dispensary patients with adequate knowledge, and
in order to advise as to the form of treatment—in a
residential institution or not,—most fitted to the patient’s
case, must know the sanitary and social circumstances
of the patient’s industrial and domiciliary life.
He must, therefore, have reports on these circumstances
respecting each patient. This raises the general
question of the relation of the tuberculosis officer
to the medical officer of health. The medical officer
of health is officially responsible for controlling the
tuberculous patient and his environment from a public
health standpoint. As the tuberculosis officer also
needs the information acquired in the inquiries which
it is the duty of the medical officer of health to make
personally or by an authorized agent, coördination of
the work of the two officers is evidently required;
and this need cause no difficulty when the tuberculosis
officer is an officer in the Public Health Department of
which the medical officer of health is the chief administrator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>


<h3><em>The Home Visitation of Patients</em></h3>

<p>This is important, (<em>a</em>) to inquire into the social circumstances
of each patient; (<em>b</em>) to instruct him in
detail as to the carrying out of instructions for treatment
and in the hygiene of his life; (<em>c</em>) to make a
sanitary survey of the dwelling house, and especially
of the patient’s bedroom, and to advise as to any
needed reforms; and (<em>d</em>) in certain cases to give actual
assistance in nursing the patient.</p>

<p>The report on these inquiries should be seen by both
the medical officer of health and the tuberculosis officer,
and on them in conjunction with the tuberculosis
officer’s knowledge of the medical condition of the
patient, the subsequent course of supervision and
treatment will depend.</p>

<p>Home visitation can be carried out by nurses attached
to the dispensary or by inspectors of the public
health department. The latter will usually be more
competent in detecting and remedying sanitary defects
in the home; the former in encouraging the patient to
carry out the needed requirements in personal hygiene
and nursing. Many visitors are equally competent in
both directions; and as the number of women specially
trained in tuberculosis work increases this will more
generally be the rule.</p>

<p>The dispensary should be the active working centre
from which home visitation is undertaken; and this is
especially important in “following up” work. Following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
up is needed for persons who have been examined
once, concerning whom there is doubt as to their
freedom from disease and who fail to present themselves
for later examination. It is needed also for
patients who have been under treatment and neglect
to continue it; and for patients who after having been
treated have been discharged and fail to report themselves
at intervals as directed. It is important to have
efficient arrangements for ascertaining these leakages
and for making the necessary inquiries. The method
of securing this will vary according to local circumstances;
but the following example given by Dr. Chapman
of an official method may be placed on record:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>When a patient is instructed to attend again at the dispensary
his name is noted in a diary under the date upon which
he is asked to attend. In some instances a definite time is
fixed for the appointment so as to save the patient’s time.
The names of all patients who attended the dispensary upon
the day appointed are ticked off as they are seen, and at the
end of the day the names of patients who have failed to
attend remain on the list. Letters are then sent reminding
these patients of their engagement and making another appointment.
If they still fail to attend they are visited by the
dispensary nurse or the health visitor. Failure to attend may
be due to relapse, and, when this is likely, an early visit of
inquiry by the nurse is advantageous.</p>

<p>Examination of a register kept for facilitating work of this
kind showed that the majority of the patients followed up
attended subsequently, and that in the cases of the remainder
non-attendance as a rule was satisfactorily explained.</p>
</div>

<p>In areas having, as yet, no adequate system of following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
up, an appreciable percentage of patients usually
cease to attend during the course of treatment at
a dispensary, and many are lost sight of after discharge
from a sanatorium. The value of the work of
a dispensary and of after-care work is materially impaired
in the absence of a system of “following up.”
As schemes develop, more stress will doubtless be
generally laid upon this branch of the dispensary
function.</p>


<h3><em>“Sanatorium Benefit.”</em></h3>

<p>Under the National Insurance Act the annual sum
of 1s 3d (30 cents) was set apart for each insured
person; as the result of subsequent bargaining with
medical practitioners 6d of this was devoted to the
domiciliary treatment of tuberculosis patients (payable
on the number of panel patients on each doctor’s list,
not on the number of his tuberculous patients), the
remainder being payable to local authorities who undertook
the provision of institutions for the treatment
of tuberculous insured patients.</p>

<p>Thus the “Sanatorium Benefit” comprises</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>A</em>. Domiciliary treatment.<br>
<em>B</em>. Institutional treatment.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<em>a</em>) Non-residential—Dispensaries.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<em>b</em>) Residential—Sanatoria,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Hospitals,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Convalescent Homes and</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">“Farm Colonies.”</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Soon after the passing of the National Insurance
Act in 1911 representations were made that tuberculosis
affected non-insured as well as insured; that
treatment of insured could have only partial success
so long as non-insured members of the same household
were neglected; and that this was work for public
health authorities which they were already partially
undertaking. It was evident that the inextricably interlaced
measures for the prevention and the treatment
of tuberculosis must accrue to the whole population;
and the mistake of the National Insurance Act
was remedied to the extent that Public Health Authorities
were informed that the National Treasury
was prepared to pay one-half of the approved expenditure
incurred by these authorities in establishing
schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis available for
the entire population. Such schemes were proceeded
with, as already indicated; but there remained the fact
that insured persons who had paid their weekly quota
and were therefore entitled to “Sanatorium Benefit”
usually interpreted this as a right to three months’
treatment in a Sanatorium. The choice of persons to
receive treatment in a Sanatorium lay with Local
Insurance Committees appointed under the National
Insurance Act, who generally acted on the advice of
the tuberculosis officer; but influences other than medical
led to the unsatisfactory use of institutional treatment.
A large number of patients were sent to and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
retained in sanatoria for prolonged periods, who
might have been adequately treated at home, or who
should have been in hospitals. Satisfactory results
for sanatorium treatment were not secured under
these conditions; and there will probably be no material
improvement until the Sanatorium Benefit is withdrawn
as a special benefit under the National Insurance
Act, and the treatment of tuberculosis becomes
an obligatory duty of Public Health Authorities, with
a minimum standard of provision to which all must
attain.</p>


<h3><em>Residential Institutions</em></h3>

<p>The extent to which these have been provided in
England since 1911 has already been stated. The
number of beds available in 1917 was 12,441, in addition
to some 9,000 beds in poor-law institutions, which
in 1911 were occupied by consumptives. From the
point of view of the provision required in residential
institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis the following
classification is useful. It is confined to pulmonary
cases:</p>

<p>Of the 12,441 beds probably 5,000 are in the hands
of voluntary organizations, and are intended for patients
in group <em>A</em>, though for the reasons set out on
pages 208 and 223 they contain a large proportion of
patients in the other groups. It appears not unlikely,
however, that the total accommodation, official and
voluntary, for patients in group A has reached one bed
per 5,000 population, the accommodation recommended
by the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis as
immediately advisable. This accommodation is unevenly
distributed and much of it is being utilised for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
patients coming within groups <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and <em>D</em>. All the
evidence available shows a great need for additional
beds for patients coming within the last-named groups.
The Departmental Committee recommended that the
total needs of the community might be assumed to
amount to one bed to 2,500 population for all stages
of pulmonary tuberculosis, in addition to poor-law accommodation.
This means a provision of some 14,000
beds in addition to the 9,000 poor-law beds, or a total
provision of about one bed to 1,500 population.</p>

<p>If we include cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis
it may be safely assumed that each community should
aim at having available for the treatment of tuberculosis
at least one bed per 1,000 inhabitants. Fewer
beds may suffice for sparsely populated communities,
and more will be needed in some towns.</p>

<p>In England various existing institutions have been
utilised in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>1. Emphasis has already been laid on the large number
of beds in <em>workhouse infirmaries under the Poor-Law
Authorities</em>. Of the historical, as well as of the
present value of this accommodation for advanced
cases of tuberculosis in the poorest section of the population—which
is most seriously exposed domestically
to massive infection,—there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>But there has been prejudice against the use of
this accommodation for insured persons, and such use
is legally precluded; and since the passing of the National<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
Insurance Act additional provision has been
made by Public Health Authorities, and ere long the
whole of the present poor-law accommodation should
come under public health authorities.</p>

<p>2. Detached pavilions of <em>hospitals for infectious diseases</em>
have also been employed for the treatment of
tuberculosis, and experience has demonstrated that in
well-conducted institutions consumptives are not exposed
to risk of acquiring acute infectious diseases.</p>

<p>The use of these institutions favours economy of
administration. It possesses the advantage that patients
are, as a rule, more accessible to their relatives
than in a sanatorium; and this renders patients suffering
from progressive disease more willing to remain
in the institution than they would otherwise be. Patients
can advantageously be placed in such an institution
for observation, before deciding whether prolonged
treatment in a distant curative sanatorium is
indicated.</p>

<p>Occasionally empty <em>smallpox hospitals</em> have also
been employed for the institutional treatment of tuberculosis;
but if this plan were to be generally adopted,
tuberculosis work would be seriously crippled if smallpox
became epidemic. The treatment of consumptives
in a smallpox hospital should only be permitted for
patients who could be at once transferred and who can
be at once vaccinated.</p>

<p><em>General hospitals</em> are well fitted to deal with the following
classes of cases of tuberculosis:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>a</em>) Patients admitted for observation, with a view to<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">diagnosis;</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>b</em>) Patients admitted to ascertain the form of treatment<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">best adapted for the patient’s needs;</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>c</em>) Emergency cases, e.g., haemoptysis;</p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>d</em>) Patients requiring surgical aid for intercurrent<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">diseases;</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>e</em>) Patients with advanced disease admitted for special<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">purposes;</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">(<em>f</em>) Patients with non-pulmonary tuberculosis, requiring<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">special surgical treatment.</span></p>

<p>In approving arrangements for the treatment of
pulmonary tuberculosis in a general hospital, it should
be made a condition that they shall not be received into
general wards of the hospital in which there are persons
suffering from other diseases, unless for a sudden
emergency, or for a short period for operative treatment,
or unless there is no expectoration, or if this, on
repeated examinations has been found to be free from
tubercle bacilli.</p>


<h3><em>Sanatoria and Combined Institutions</em></h3>

<p>To ensure efficiency in a sanatorium a resident physician
is, as a rule, necessary; and this is desirable also
for a tuberculosis hospital. Smaller authorities may
be unable to combine together or to provide alone an
institution with about 100 beds, which is generally regarded
as the unit best adapted to secure a well-placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and efficiently organized institution, with due regard
to economy of administration. To provide such a
unit, and even apart from this, the desirability of treating
patients in all stages of disease in the same institution
should be considered. Experience in England
has shown that this combination presents no medical
administrative difficulties, provided that the type of
sleeping accommodation for patients consists chiefly
of rooms for one or two patients or of small wards.
With such an arrangement, if a section of the institution
consisting of one or two bedded rooms or small
wards is devoted to patients needing special nursing,
irrespective of the stage of disease, efficiency is secured,
the special needs of each class of patients can
be met, and—this is especially important—the patient
with advanced disease cannot infer the hopeless character
of his illness from his place in the institution.
Such a combined institution affords the medical and
administrative advantage that the tuberculosis officer
can, as a rule, watch his patients throughout the whole
course of their treatment, both in the residential institution
and at the dispensary.</p>

<p>In choosing a sanatorium an area of at least twenty
acres should be available; and at least one-fifth of an
acre should be allowed per patient. For a hospital a
smaller area is permissible. There should be a floor-space
of at least 64 square feet for each patient; and
the centres of the heads of adjacent beds should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
be distant less than 8 feet measured against the wall.
Experience appears to show that in a large sanatorium
one nurse will generally be adequate for every twelve
patients. In a hospital for advanced patients, or in a
combined institution a larger staff may be required.</p>


<h3><em>Observation Beds</em></h3>

<p>There is but little systematised experience as yet of
the employment of observation beds; a difficulty arising
from the fact that the tuberculosis officer under
most local tuberculosis schemes has not been sufficiently
in touch with the medical officers of the residential
institutions to which he sends patients. There
are practical difficulties in the provision of observation
beds on the dispensary premises, including the
difficulty of due regard to economy of administration
in the nursing and treatment of three or four in-patients
at a dispensary. Whatever arrangements are
made for such beds, it is desirable that the tuberculosis
officer should have access to the patients treated in
them.</p>


<h3><em>General Observations on Treatment in Sanatoria</em></h3>

<p>In 1911 the extent and limitations of the utility of
sanatorium treatment of tuberculosis were already
fairly well recognized by physicians; and it is unfortunate
that in connection with the passage of the National
Insurance Act this treatment acquired a somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
political aspect, and became the subject of much
popular misapprehension and exaggeration. Disappointment
necessarily followed on the sending of
patients to sanatoria for treatment with a view to cure
at a stage of disease when anything beyond ephemeral
improvement was impossible. The patients who, under
present conditions, are admitted to sanatoria come
roughly into two groups:</p>

<p>First. Patients with limited disease and little or no
systemic disturbance. Comparatively few patients who
now enter sanatoria come within this group.</p>

<p>Second. Patients with more extensive or acute disease.
In a large proportion of cases within the first
group the immediate result of sanatorium treatment
extending over three to six months is the complete
restoration of general health and working capacity
with arrest of disease. In a large further proportion
of cases in the same group there is recovery of working
capacity and apparent restoration of general health
without complete arrest of disease.</p>

<p>For patients coming within the second group a similar
period of treatment in a sanatorium results:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) In restoration of general health and working
capacity with arrest of disease in only a small proportion
of cases;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) In recovery of working capacity and apparent
restoration of general health without arrest of disease
in a fair proportion of cases; and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) In the remainder, disease progresses steadily
with or without temporary improvement in general
health.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of sanatorium patients varies
greatly. Some of them maintain their health indefinitely
on return to their ordinary life. Others who
have been discharged with arrested disease ultimately
relapse, even if they live under excellent environmental
conditions; and such relapses are excessive among
those who return to unsatisfactory conditions of life
and work.</p>

<p>Among patients discharged from a sanatorium without
arrest of the disease a small proportion ultimately
recover completely, but the majority relapse at a date
which is earlier or later in accordance more or less
with the conditions under which they live and work
and the severity of their disease.</p>

<p>The experience of the last few years has been that
only a small proportion of the patients admitted to
sanatoria are cases in which arrest of the disease can
be anticipated; and this will continue until the disease
is more generally detected at an earlier stage than at
present, and the sanatorium treatment is prescribed
and continued solely in accord with the medical needs
of the patient.</p>

<p>The conditions of local administration of the Sanatorium
Benefit under the National Insurance Act have
led to a very high proportion of consumptives being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
treated in sanatoria with a view to cure, who might
advantageously have received educational treatment
for a few weeks and then have been treated at home
or at a tuberculosis dispensary. Furthermore, a large
number of patients with advanced disease have been
sent to sanatoria for whom treatment in a hospital was
more appropriate.</p>


<h3><em>Educational Work of Sanatoria</em></h3>

<p>Apart from the question of cure, which with belated
treatment can only be expected in a minority of cases,
the sanatorium serves an important purpose, not only
in restoring patients to a considerable degree of health
and working capacity for a longer or shorter time, but
also in educating the patients how to live and conduct
themselves. A stay in a sanatorium for a short period—a
month or six weeks—under doctors and nurses
who realise the value of this work—would there were
more of these!—secures the training of the patient on
lines beneficial to his future health and enables him to
obviate all danger for others.</p>

<p>In such a short stay in a sanatorium what may be
called tuberculosis discipline can be and is acquired
when the sanatorium is satisfactorily administered;
and the patient thus disciplined is in a much more
favorable position for securing his own welfare and
that of others than the undisciplined patient, just as
the soldier who has had routine drill under a competent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
instructor is more efficient than the untrained
recruit.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks as to the treatment of tuberculosis
in sanatoria illustrate certain well-known features
in the natural history of this disease. In the majority
of instances of disease recognised under present conditions
we are dealing with a slowly progressing disease.
This sometimes become spontaneously arrested;
occasionally it may be arrested or its course delayed
under medical treatment at home associated with manageable
changes in domestic and industrial life. In
still further instances it may be arrested by treatment
in a sanatorium; while for other cases sanatorium
treatment, however prolonged, is followed by only
temporary improvement, and the chief benefit thus
received is that of training as to mode of life, which
might have been secured by a much less protracted
stay in the institution, followed by measures supplementing
sanatorium treatment. We have further to
recognise the fact that, under present conditions of
social life and medical practice, many tuberculous patients
will slowly, by intermittent stages, but none the
less surely, die from tuberculosis in the course of one,
three or five years. Regard must be paid to this fact
if our total measures for the control of tuberculosis
are to be successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>


<h3><em>Hospital Treatment</em></h3>

<p>This fact emphasizes the importance of adequate
hospital treatment for all patients acutely ill or bed-ridden,
who cannot be hygienically treated at home;
and the importance becomes evident of exercising
<em>complete supervision over and provision for the whole
of the sick life of the consumptive, whether he is trending
towards complete recovery or to death</em>.</p>

<p>Such complete supervision and provision necessitates
further development in three directions in which
beginnings have already been made:</p>


<h3><em>Industrial Colonies</em></h3>

<p>These are the provision of “Farm or Industrial
Colonies,” the adaptation of domestic dwellings to
meet the special needs of consumptives, and the more
complete organization of “Care” and “After-care”
arrangements.</p>

<p>In a large proportion of cases, the patient on leaving
the sanatorium is unable at once to embark on full
work without risk of early relapse, or to refrain from
this without endangering his nutrition and that of his
family. His work, furthermore, may be unsuitable
for a consumptive.</p>

<p>This has led to many tentative efforts to train the
consumptive in a suitable occupation while under sanatorium
treatment, or in an industrial colony which
should preferably be attached to or in close communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
with a sanatorium, in order that the patient
may continue under skilled medical supervision. The
graduated labour which forms part of the routine
method of treatment in many sanatoria can be made a
preparatory stage in this industrial training. The
training may be made to merge into the pursuit of an
actual livelihood; and then the sanatorium becomes
an industrial colony. Market gardening, pig-keeping,
forestry, and other occupations may be thus pursued
for protracted periods, if the patients are suitably selected.
The ex-patients continue to live under protected
conditions, earning part at least of their livelihood.
Attempts in this direction are not likely to
have wide success unless the patient is re-instated in
his family; and the most promising efforts are those
which install the ex-consumptive with his family in a
cottage near a sanatorium, where he can remain under
partial medical supervision, while engaged in his daily
work. It remains to be seen to what extent such
arrangements are practicable on a considerable scale,
and the experiments now being made will be watched
with interest.</p>


<h3><em>Special Dwellings and Help in Support</em></h3>

<p>An alternative to the “colony” proposal, which will
probably be found practicable in a much larger number
of cases is to arrange for the ex-patient to be housed
at his home under special conditions and for his work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to be graduated according to his physical condition,
assistance being given by way of payment of rent, or
otherwise to ensure that the patient and his family
live under satisfactory conditions. Proposals have
been made by Dr. Chapman in a report to the English
Local Government Board that in connection with new
housing schemes a certain proportion of the houses
erected should have rooms providing free perflation
of air reserved for consumptive patients. If with this
is combined the assistance indicated above, the risk of
the ex-patient relapsing will be materially reduced, and
the risk of other members of the family becoming
consumptive may be obviated.</p>

<p>Whatever methods are employed, the principle already
enunciated must be maintained that the patient
in his own interest and in that of his family must be
the subject of uninterrupted care and supervision.</p>

<p>In securing this end <em>Care Committees</em> play a valuable
part. Owing to the war their development has
been retarded; but a local scheme for such supervision
and assistance as the members or agents of a
Care Committee can give forms an essential part of a
complete tuberculosis scheme.</p>

<p>These Committees are formed of non-official persons,
inasmuch as a large share of their work is at
present beyond the scope of official possibilities, outside
the poor-law organization; they can help,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">(<em>a</em>) in obtaining appropriate work for the ex-patients;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(<em>b</em>) in supplementing his wages;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(<em>c</em>) in providing separate sleeping accommodation for</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">the patient, additional food or clothing, or in</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">loaning out an additional bed or bedding;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(<em>d</em>) in aiding the family during the absence of the</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">prematurely, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(<em>e</em>) in encouraging each patient to take the necessary</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">precautions and to adopt the special treatment</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">recommended for him.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of these activities overlap into the activities
of the tuberculosis officer and of the visiting nurse of
the local authority; but there need be no practical difficulty
in adjusting this. It is important that Care
Committees should act in coöperation with local authorities,
insurance committees, and charitable agencies,
and should have representatives of these bodies
on them. The medical officer of health and tuberculosis
should also be ex-officio members of their committee.</p>

<p><em>Summary</em>.—The preceding review of the problem of
tuberculosis may be summarised in a few final statements.</p>

<p>1. Our knowledge of tuberculosis, if fully applied
by combined attack on the disease by all known
methods, is adequate to secure a great reduction in
its prevalence, if not its absolute abolition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>This is true, although certain problems respecting
tuberculosis still need elucidation, e.g., as to improved
methods of treating the diseases, and of increasing
individual immunity during exposure to protracted
infection.</p>

<p>2. Domestic protection is at once practicable against
infected cows’ milk; and control of this source of infection
at its source is also practicable.</p>

<p>3. Of the circumstances favouring the development
of pulmonary tuberculosis industrial dust and domestic
overcrowding are the most potent. More detailed
and systematic supervision of factories and workshops
is needed, followed by general adoption of remedies,
which would increase industrial efficiency as well as
reduce tuberculosis.</p>

<p>4. Tuberculosis is especially a “bedroom infection.”
But improvement in housing is a dual problem, and it
is a blunder to assume that improved housing, so long
as the healthy and tuberculous sick continue to be
housed together, will produce a rapid decline in the
prevalence of tuberculosis. Hospital provision for the
sick is as necessary as improved general housing.</p>

<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The subject of child welfare, in its chief developments,
cannot be separated from that of Public Health,
of which it forms a constituent part, though I do not
ignore the fact that child welfare is largely dependent
also on the extent to which child labor is exploited,
and to which expectant and nursing mothers,—as also
other mothers whose extra-domestic employment or
whose employment for gain is within the home itself,—involves
neglect of young children.</p>

<p>Improvement in child welfare has occurred as the
sanitary and social progress of the country has advanced.
Whereas in the decade 1871-80, when money
began to be spent more freely on elementary sanitary
reform, the expectation of life or mean after-lifetime
at birth of males was 41.4 years and of females was
44.6 years; in the years 1910-12 these had increased
to 51.5 and 55.4 years respectively. The greater part
of the saving of life which this addition of ten years
to the average duration of life was the result of reduced
mortality in children under five years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>The first direct steps towards the reduction of infant
mortality were directed against epidemic or summer
diarrhœa. Medical officers of health have always
been required in their annual reports to summarize the
vital statistics in their districts; and since 1905 a more
detailed statement of infant mortality during each part
of infancy has been required. Annually, therefore,
as well as when they received the weekly returns of
deaths from the local registrars, there was forced
upon their attention the fact that deaths of infants
under one year of age formed a high proportion of
total deaths at all ages (12.9 per cent. in 1917), and
that of these infantile deaths a large proportion were
caused by diarrhœa, the number varying with the temperature
and the deficiency of rainfall in the summer
months. In 1912, a year of relatively small mortality
from diarrhœa, this disease caused 8.1 per cent. of all
deaths under one year of age.</p>

<p>For many years past it has been customary for medical
officers of health to issue warnings as to summer
diarrhœa, to arrange for the distribution of leaflets of
advice concerning the disease, and to urge the necessity
of more thorough cleanliness both municipal and
domestic during the summer months. Even before
the early notification of births became obligatory, in
many areas the addresses of infants were obtained
from the registrars of births and special visits were
made to the mothers of infants during the months of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
June and July and especially to the mothers of those
infants who were known to be artificially fed.</p>

<p>The reports of medical officers of health of many
of the large towns from 1890 onwards show that much
valuable work was being accomplished, and the way
was being prepared for more general measures against
infant mortality.</p>

<p>The importance of municipal sanitation in aiding
the elimination of diarrhœal mortality is illustrated in
the experience of many towns, and strikingly by the
comparative experience of Leicester and Nottingham.
The chief difference between the sanitary condition of
the two towns was that in Nottingham in 1909 pail
closets still served more than half the houses, while
Leicester had abandoned this system entirely, substituting
water-closets. Between 1889-93 and 1909 the
diarrhœal mortality in Leicester had declined 52 per
cent.; in Nottingham it had only declined 4 per cent.</p>

<p>Diarrhœa is not the only disease of infancy which
can be greatly diminished by improved public health
administration. Tuberculosis and whooping cough
and measles figure largely in the infantile death returns.
Over 21 per cent. of the total deaths in infancy
are due to these three diseases and to diarrhœa. The
amount of syphilis appearing in the death-returns is
small; but its actual amount is much greater than the
figures show. If pneumonia and bronchitis, which
account for 19 per cent. of the deaths in infancy, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
regarded—as they should—as infective diseases, then
it may be said that the problem of saving child life and
securing the correlative improvement in the standard
of health of children who survive to higher ages, <em>consists
very largely in the prevention of infections</em>, including
diarrhœal diseases and acute respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>It follows from this that even if the limited and
erroneous view be taken that Sanitary Authorities are
concerned only with the prevention of infectious diseases,
the reduction of infant mortality is a duty devolving
on these authorities, and cannot be effectively
carried out without their coöperation. Voluntary
effort must therefore always, in large measure, be
directed towards stimulating local authorities to perform
their duties.</p>

<p>The influence of diarrhœal summer mortality on the
progress of child welfare work is further shown by
the fact that among the earliest efforts were those to
provide pure cows’ milk to infants. In England official
Milk Depots for this purpose were never numerous;
and little voluntary effort went in this direction.
There now remain very few such Milk Depots; but
many local authorities provide milk, more particularly
dried milk, to infants for whom it is specially prescribed
at Infant Consultations. Early investigations
at Brighton and elsewhere showed that the mortality
of infants fed on condensed milk,—chiefly of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
sweetened variety,—was greater than that of infants
fed on fresh cows’ milk, and directed attention to the
supreme importance of domestic cleanliness in the
prevention of summer diarrhœa. The Milk Depots
and the concurrent agitation for purer cows’ milk
served a useful purpose; though it cannot yet be said
that the cows’ milk ordinarily supplied in England is
satisfactorily clean.</p>

<p>It became evident ere long that the broadcast distribution
of instructions as to how cows’ milk might
safely be stored and prepared for infants had but a
limited utility, and that the directions given were liable
to be misinterpreted by mothers as an encouragement
to abandon breast-feeding; and there is reason to believe
that these directions did sometimes have this
effect. Hence the importance of the work initiated by
the late Dr. Sykes at the St. Pancras School for
Mothers, which brought into relief the importance of
encouraging breast-feeding by every possible means.
In towns in which the aided supply of milk was continued,
advice as to its use was also initiated; and thus
gradually Infant Consultations, in which the main element
was the giving of individual advice and treatment
as required, superseded Milk Depots, and were established
in very large numbers where Milk Depots had
never been started. These had educational as well
as medical and hygienic activities; and there need be
no dispute as to the relative value of these two aspects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of the work of Infant Consultations (also known as
Schools for Mothers, Child Welfare Centres, Baby
Weighings, Mothers’ Welcomes, etc.); for whether
advice and instruction are given to the individual
mother or to mothers collectively,—or as is advisable
in both ways,—it should be exactly the advice which a
physician skilled in the hygiene of infancy as well as
in the treatment of infantile complaints would give to
his individual patient. In this sense it remains true,
as Professor Budin, the distinguished founder of Infant
Consultations said: “An infant consultation is
worth precisely as much as the presiding physician.”
This is true whether it is possible to arrange for a physician
to be present at each meeting of a Child Welfare
Centre; or whether, as has happened during the Great
War in England, nurses or health visitors trained
under such a physician have given hygienic advice in
his absence.</p>


<h3><em>The Notification of Births</em></h3>

<p>For many years before the Notification of Births
Act was passed, it had been customary, especially in
towns, to arrange for inquiry by a sanitary inspector
or female visitor into death occurring under one year
of age, and in many instances for the giving of systematic
advice to mothers concerning their infants.
More than twenty years ago the Manchester and Salform
Sanitary Association had initiated a system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
home visitation by volunteer ladies and by women
workers paid by the Association who went from house
to house, gave elementary sanitary advice, and reported
serious defects to the Sanitary Authority. The
City Council at an early stage showed its appreciation
of the importance of this work by giving grants
towards the expenditure incurred.</p>

<p>In order to enable early visits to be made, the town
council of Salford had begun as early as 1899 a system
of voluntary notification of births by midwives.</p>

<p>Prior to the stage at which early notifications of
births was obtained, the medical officer of health was
dependent for his information on the registration of
births, for which an interval of six weeks after birth
was permitted before it became compulsory. During
this interval a large proportion of the total mortality
of infancy had occurred,—approximately one-fifth of
the total deaths in the first year after birth occur in
the first week and one-third in the first month after
birth,—and the possibility of successfully influencing
the mother to continue breast-feeding had gone. The
action of the town of Huddersfield in 1906 in obtaining
Parliamentary power to secure the compulsory
notification of births within thirty-six hours of birth
represented a rapid growth of opinion based on experience
in that and other towns to the effect that in the
absence of early information of birth the necessary
sanitary precautions and counsel as to personal hygiene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
could not be given with the greatest prospect of
success. This local pioneer work doubtless facilitated
the passing of the Notification of Births Act in 1907.</p>

<p>Much important work followed the notification of
births. Home visits to the mother were regarded and
continue to be regarded as the most important part of
this work; but there also grew up rapidly the present
system of Infant Consultations and similar organizations.</p>

<p>The Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915,
not only made the enforcement of this act universal,
but it also empowered each local authority administering
the Act to exercise any powers which a sanitary
authority possesses under the Public Health Acts “for
the purpose of the care of expectant mothers, nursing
mothers, and young children.” In drawing the attention
of Local Authorities to the terms of the Act the
Local Government Board, as well as earlier in the war,
deprecated false economy during the war. They said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>At a time like the present the urgent need for taking all
possible steps to secure the health of mothers and children and
to diminish ante-natal and post-natal infant mortality is obvious,
and the Board are confident that they can rely upon
local authorities making the fullest use of the powers conferred
on them.</p>
</div>

<p>The Board in the same circular laid stress on “the
importance of linking up this work with the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
medical and sanitary services provided by local authorities
under the Public Health and other Acts.”</p>

<p>The passing of this Act has been followed by an
increasingly rapid development of Maternity and Child
Welfare work, and the Maternity and Child Welfare
Act passed in August, 1918, made it obligatory on
each Council exercising powers under the Act to appoint
a Maternity and Child Welfare Committee,
which must include at least two women, and may include
persons specially qualified by training or experience
in subjects relating to health and maternity who
are not members of the Council.</p>

<p>In the circular letter sent out to local authorities explaining
the new Act, the Local Government Board
reëmphasizes its previously stated views that child
welfare work was second only in importance to direct
war work, and was really a “measure of war emergence,”
and added:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p class="no-indent">although we have enjoined as local authorities the necessity
of the strictest of economy in public expenditure, we have
urged increased activity in work which has for its object the
preservation of infant life and health. We are glad to note
that the great majority of local authorities have realized the
value of continuing and extending their efforts for child welfare
at the present time.</p>
</div>


<h3><em>The Causes of Child Mortality</em></h3>

<p>For detailed consideration of the causes of infant
mortality and of mortality during the next four years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
of life in England and Wales, the reader may be referred
to official reports by the writer.</p>

<p>No consistent and continuous decline had taken
place in infant mortality prior to 1900, although there
had been marked reduction of the mortality in each
of the next four years of life. This difference corresponds
in the main with the facts that greater success
had been achieved in the general measures of sanitation
and in the reduction of prevalence of and mortality
from such infectious diseases as scarlet fever,
diphtheria, and enteric fever, than in respect of the
special causes of mortality in infancy. These special
causes may be placed under three headings: First, infections,—acute
respiratory diseases, measles, whooping
cough, syphilis, tuberculosis, and diarrhœa; second,
errors of nutrition, due largely to poverty, to mismanagement,
and to imperfect provision of facilities
for healthy family life; and third, developmental conditions
present at the birth of the infants. Under
none of these headings had marked success been
achieved prior to 1900, though the steady work devoted
to the subject of diarrhœa had already begun to
show fruit.</p>

<p>The statistics of infant mortality may be stated as
follows:</p>

<p>The above are the crude rates, the infantile death-rate
being stated by the usual method per 1,000 births
<em>during the same year</em>. Owing to the great decline of
births during the war, this method overstates the infant
mortality in recent years. In a table given in the
Registrar-General’s annual report for 1917, this unusual
source of error is corrected. When this is done,
and the infantile deaths are stated “per 1,000 of population
aged 0-1,” the rates for the years 1912-17
inclusive in successive years became respectively</p>

<p class="center">104, 117, 113, 111, 98, and 94.</p>

<p>In other words, there has been a steady and uninterrupted
decline in the death-rate of infants during the
war.</p>

<p>This decline has followed similar declines in preceding
years, and it is to be noted that much of this decline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
occurred during the period when the hygienic work
effecting child-welfare was confined to general public
health measures. Thus it anticipated the more direct
and active measures adopted by voluntary societies
and by local authorities for the prevention of infant
mortality. Comparing the five year periods 1896-1900
and 1901-05, a decrease in the death-rate of 12
per cent. is seen; comparing 1901-05 with 1906-10, a
decline of 15 per cent. occurred; comparing 1906-10
with the average experience of the three years 1911-13
mortality declined 5 per cent.; comparing these
three years with the average experience of the five
years 1914-18, during which war conditions prevailed
more or less, a reduction 9 per cent. was experienced.
The actual reduction during war time is greater than
is indicated by these percentages, when allowance is
made for the statistical error indicated above. The
exceptional experience of the year 1911 illustrates one
of the chief sources of error in forming conclusions
on the experience of a single year. In this year the
summer was excessively hot, and summer diarrhœa
prevailed to an exceptional extent; and the illustration
is important, as serving to remind us of the limitations
of the value of statistical tests and of the fact that
increase of good work tending to improve child life
may be associated temporarily with increase of total
infant mortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>


<h3><em>The Influence of School Medical Inspection</em></h3>

<p>In the development of child welfare work in England
important place must be given to the system of
medical inspection of school children initiated in 1907.
The numerous physical defects found in school children
have led to the beginning of measures for remedial
action, confined in some areas to measures for
securing greater cleanliness and the treatment of minor
skin diseases; but extending in other areas to such
measures as the remedial treatment of adenoids, the
cure of ringworm, the correction of errors of refraction,
and the provision of dental treatment. Perhaps
the chief value of the system of medical inspection of
school children has been the fact that it has demonstrated
the extent to which children when they first
come to school are already suffering from physical disease
which might have been prevented or minimized
by attention in the pre-school period. The information
thus accumulated has had much influence in encouraging
the institution of Infant Consultations, with
a view to the early discovery of disease or of tendency
to disease.</p>


<h3><em>The Influence of Statistical Studies</em></h3>

<p>The intensive study of our national and of local vital
statistics has also had a most important bearing on the
further development of maternity and child welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
work. In successive official reports it has been shown
that infant mortality varies greatly in different parts
of the country, irrespective of climatic conditions;
that it varies greatly in different parts of the same
town, in accordance with variations in respect of industrial
and housing conditions, of local sanitation, of
poverty and alcoholism; that the variations extend to
different portions of infant life, the death-rate in infants
under a week, or under a month in age, for instance,
being two or three times as high in some areas
as in others; and that the distribution of special diseases
in infancy similarly varies greatly. Intensive
studies of infant mortality on these and other lines
have pointed plainly the directions in which preventive
work is especially called for; and have incidentally
demonstrated the fundamental value of accurate statistics
of births and of deaths in the child welfare
campaign. Surveys of local conditions both statistical
and based on actual local observations form an indispensable
preliminary to and concomitant of good child
welfare work; and it is to combined work on these
lines that the improvement of recent years is largely
attributable. To <em>act helpfully</em> we must <em>know thoroughly</em>
the summation of conditions which form the
evil to be attacked.</p>

<p>One important result of investigations such as those
already mentioned has been to bring more clearly into
relief the fact, which previously had been partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
neglected, that <em>child welfare work can only succeed
in so far as the welfare of the mother is also maintained</em>.</p>

<p>This may imply extensions of work involving serious
economic considerations; but apart from such possibilities
and apart from questions of housing, and of
provision of additional domestic facilities for assisting
the overworked mother, there is ample evidence that
medical and hygienic measures by themselves can do
much to relieve the excessive strain on the mother
which childbearing under present conditions often involves.</p>


<h3><em>The Course of Mortality from Childbearing</em></h3>

<p>The general course of mortality from childbearing
(including deaths ascribable to pregnancy) in England
and Wales is shown by the following table:</p>

</table>


<p>It will be noted that although there has been a
marked decline of deaths from puerperal sepsis, the
death-rate from other complications of childbearing
has not declined. The decline in puerperal sepsis is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
general throughout the country, and evidences the
greater care in midwifery both on the part of doctors
and of midwives. The administration of the Midwives
Act, 1902, has doubtless done much to secure
this. The death-rate from conditions other than puerperal
fever continues to differ greatly throughout the
country. It is highest in Welsh counties, Westmoreland,
Lancashire and Cheshire coming next in order
of unfavourable portion; in many industrial, including
textile, towns it is also excessive. The general conclusion
reached by the writer in an elaborate official
report on the subject is that “the quality and availability
of skilled assistance before, during, and after
childbirth are probably the most important factors in
determining the remarkable and serious differences in
respect of mortality from childbearing shown in the
report.”—“The differences are caused in the main by
differences in availability of skilled assistance when
needed in pregnancy, and at and after childbirth.”</p>


<h3><em>The Midwives Act, 1902</em></h3>

<p>This Act forbade any woman after April 1, 1906,
who was not certified under the Act, from using the
title of midwife or any similar description of herself.
It forbade after April 1, 1910, any such woman from
“habitually and for gain attending women in childbirth,
except under the direction of a qualified medical
practitioner”; and it forbade any certified midwife to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
use an uncertified person as her substitute. The Act
defined the limits of function of the midwife by stating
that the Act did not confer upon her any title to give
certificates of death or of still-birth, or to take charge
of any abnormality or disease in connection with parturition.</p>

<p>The Act set up the Central Midwives Board, giving
it special disciplinary powers over midwives. It also
imposed on county councils and the councils of county
boroughs the duty of supervising the work of midwives.
For further details the Act itself and the
Rules of the Central Midwives Board made under the
Act should be consulted.</p>

<p>The Midwives Act, 1918, gave further powers to the
Central Midwives Board and to local supervising authorities,
and made it the duty of the latter to pay the
fee of a doctor called in by a midwife in any of the
emergencies for which Rules are made by the Central
Midwives Board, the fee paid to be in accordance with
a scale prescribed by the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>As at least three-fourths of the total births in England
and Wales are attended by midwives with or
without the assistance of doctors, their work has great
importance in relation to the reduction of maternal
disablement and mortality and to the prevention of
early infant mortality, and it is of happy augury that
they are being enlisted more and more in official work
for safeguarding the health of the mother and her unborn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
or recently delivered infant. An important recent
addition has been made to the rules of the Central
Midwives Board, which makes it obligatory on the
midwife to notify to the medical officer of health any
instance, while the patient is under her charge, in which
for any reason breast-feeding has been discontinued.</p>

<p><em>Administrative Work.</em>—Largely through the machinery
provided by the Midwives Act and the Notification
of Births Act a system of supervision of maternity
and child welfare has been organized in every
county and county borough, and this has been responsible
for a large share of the improvement experienced
in recent years. The character and extent of development
of the work varies greatly in different centres;
and as a rule the work is more fully developed in
county boroughs than in counties. In county districts
it has sometimes been found necessary to unite
the offices of assistant inspector of midwives, infant
visitor and tuberculosis visitor in one adequately
trained health visitor, thus saving time in travelling by
enabling the visitor to have a smaller district allotted
to her than if she undertook only one branch of work.
In some counties the school nurse’s work is also undertaken
by the health visitor. In some country areas
arrangements have been made for infant visiting to
be carried out by district nurses who are also midwives.</p>

<p><em>Voluntary Workers.</em>—Much of the success so far
achieved in improving the health conditions of infancy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
and childhood has been secured by coöperation
between voluntary and official health visitors. Excellent
work has been done by local and other societies,
particularly during the last ten years, in educating
public opinion and in direct assistance to mothers and
their infants. It is essential that such voluntary work
should have a nucleus of highly trained and well-paid
workers; but given this condition, a large amount of
good work can be accomplished by voluntary aid.</p>

<p>The main work has been that of the <em>health visitor</em>.
The details of this work, the conditions of qualification
of workers, the number of visits which it is desirable
to make, the character of the advice intended to be
given at these visits are set out in an official memorandum
of the Medical Officer of the Local Government
Board and it is unnecessary to repeat this information
in these pages.</p>

<p>A similar remark applies to the next most important
development of work, the institution of <em>Maternity and
Child Welfare Centres</em>. The conditions of work of
these institutions are set out in the same document.</p>


<h3><em>Training and Provision of Midwives</em></h3>

<p>The provision of additional trained midwives is a
pressing problem. The increased cost of living, longer
training required, and the rapid development of less
laborious and more lucrative occupations, have made it
difficult to secure women to train as midwives, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
continue to practise in this capacity after qualification.
In many industrial areas the older <em>bonâ fide</em> midwife
is preferred, although it is the almost universal experience
that the trained midwife more quickly detects
conditions endangering the life of the mother or infant,
and sends for medical help. In order to encourage
further the supply of practising midwives, the
government gives grants for increased remuneration
to midwives newly appointed by local authorities, sufficient
to recoup them in the course of a few years’
service for the cost of their training.</p>

<p>At a recent date, of some 30,543 trained midwives
on the Roll, only 6,754 were returned as being in actual
practice as such.</p>

<p>In order to make midwives available for all women
needing them, the Board repays to local authorities
and voluntary associations half the cost of the provision
of a midwife for necessitous women. During
the Great War a woman might receive assistance in
her confinement from several central sources; for in
addition to the above</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was evidently need for simplification and unification
of effort in the above cases.</p>

<p>In many instances maternity nursing is required.
The midwife may have too many patients to be able
to give this during the ten days in which she is in
charge of the patient; and even when she carries out
her duty in this respect in accordance with the Rules
of the Central Midwives Board additional help is required
in the feeding and care of the mother and infant,
and in the care of the household. Often also
nursing is required for both mother and infant for a
considerable period beyond the ten days. For these
persons the government gives grants for maternity
nursing and for “home helps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Even when all the above requirements are or can be
fulfilled, there remain a large number of cases of pregnant
women, and especially of unmarried women, who
cannot be satisfactorily confined at home, either because
of their social or sanitary circumstances, or because
abnormal or complicated childbirth is expected.
For such cases hospital provision is needed. This is
one of the most urgent requirements of the present
time.</p>

<p>Under present conditions, institutional lying-in provision
is chiefly voluntary in character; and the government
has advised local authorities to contract for
its use, rather than wait for the erection of special
hospitals. In other instances houses are being taken
and adapted as maternity homes.</p>


<h3><em>Ante-natal Work</em></h3>

<p>The progress made in the organisation of ante-natal
work is slow for reasons which are fairly obvious.
There has been difficulty under war conditions in securing
assistance from doctors and midwives. There
is the well-known difficulty as to notification of pregnancy,
which the government has not encouraged, except
when the definite consent of the mother has been
previously obtained. The facilities for help provided
at the Centre have in some areas attracted patients;
and health visitors and midwives have done much in
other areas to persuade mothers of the advisability of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
safeguarding themselves against possible complications,
as well as of securing adequate preparation for
the lying-in period.</p>

<p>This subject is closely associated with that of abortions,
still-births, and deaths in the first two weeks after
birth. One of the most promising methods for securing
the sound development of ante-natal work consists
in the investigation of still-births and early infant
mortality. When these inquiries are made mothers
can be induced to obtain medical advice not only at the
time, but also in the event of a subsequent pregnancy.
The investigation at the patient’s home of all such
cases and assistance in prevention of recurrence of
unnecessary ante-natal, natal, and early post-natal
deaths have as great an importance as the building up
of a successful ante-natal clinic. The anti-syphilis
work now being carried on will help greatly in this
direction.</p>


<h3><em>Dental Assistance</em></h3>

<p>There has been a large extension of dental assistance
at Centres for expectant and for nursing mothers,
and for children, especially in the metropolis and its
vicinity. The government has lately extended its
grant to cover dentures for mothers who are nursing
or pregnant, if the medical officer of the Centre is
satisfied that the woman’s health will be materially
improved by the denture, and that she is unable to provide
it for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>


<h3><em>Creches</em></h3>

<p>Creches and day nurseries may be expected to exercise
influence in educating mothers in the care of their
children. For this purpose it is very desirable to have
the creche attached to or near an infant welfare centre.</p>

<p>These creches, unless managed with the most rigid
medical and general cleanliness, are very apt to spread
infectious diseases; not merely such diseases as whooping
cough, measles, and chickenpox, but also catarrhal
and diarrhœal diseases. In the prevention of all of
these the enforcement of the strictest cleanliness is
essential, especially during the summer months for
the last named diseases. For the prevention of catarrhal
infections, it is essential that the creche should
be conducted, so far as practicable, on strict open-air
lines. Open-air creches give admirable occasional relief
to mothers, even when these do not go out to work.
The “toddler’s playground” is a blessing to all concerned,
but the indoor creche may be, and often is,
mischievous. The risks are greatly reduced by insisting
on open-air conditions and by not allowing large
groups of children to come together. Smaller groups
mean greatly decreased possibility of cross-infection.</p>


<h3><em>Observation Beds at Child Welfare Centres</em></h3>

<p>At infant welfare centres infants are not infrequently
seen who fail to make progress while living at
home, and who yet are not ill enough to be sent to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
hospital. This especially applies to cases of defective
nutrition. For these cases beds in connection with
centres have been found to be necessary for observation
purposes and to initiate further treatment. In
some instances, especially for failure of breast-feeding,
it is advisable to admit the mother with the infant.</p>

<p>On July 30, 1914, the Local Government Board sent
a circular letter and a covering memorandum by their
Medical Officer which may be claimed to have been the
starting point of maternity and child welfare work on
a larger scale, more generally distributed throughout
the country, and more completely covering the whole
sphere of medical and hygienic work for this purpose
than had previously been envisaged. Although the
country at that time might be said to be already under
the shadow of war, these documents had been previously
prepared, and their appearance four days before
the declaration of war was a coincidence. The
chief burden of the additional work to which local
authorities were urged was that there should be <em>continuity
in dealing with the whole period from before
birth until the time when the child is entered upon a
school register</em>; and the memorandum contemplated
that “medical advice and, where necessary, treatment
should be continuously and systematically available
for expectant mothers and for children till they are
entered on a school register, and that arrangements
should be made for home visitation throughout this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
period.” It was added that “the work of home visitation
is one to which the Board attach very great importance
and in promoting schemes laid down in the
accompanying memorandum the first step should be
the appointment of an adequate staff of health
visitors.”</p>

<p>The main provisions of this memorandum are
printed on page <a href="#Page_135">135</a>.</p>

<p>The increase of work since that date may be gathered
from the following table, which shows the increase
each year in the number of health visitors, of
child welfare centres, and of grants given on the 50
per cent. basis by the Local Government Board and
the Board of Education.</p>

<p>These grants do not cover the entire scope of child
welfare work carried out throughout the country, and
their amount must not be taken as a complete indication
of the extent of this work.</p>

<p>The increase during the war period has been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
great; and this can be attributed to the desire to do
everything practicable for mothers and children, especially
those belonging to soldiers and sailors who were
risking their lives for the country; and to the increased
realisation of the importance of preserving and improving
our chief national asset which consists in a
healthy population. During this period there was a
great increase in the industrial employment of women,
including married women, in factories including munition
and other works. This increase it is believed
amounted to a million and a half workers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many adverse influences, to
which must be added great overcrowding in many industrial
areas, especially those in which new industries
were hurriedly started, and the increasing cost of food
and especially of milk with a scarcity of supply, it has
been seen that infant mortality remained low and on
the whole declined during the whole period of the war.</p>

<p>To what circumstances can this be ascribed?</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to assume that this result was entirely
due to the active measures favorable to maternity
and child welfare which were taken as an unexampled
scale, though these measures can claim an
important share in the result.</p>

<p>A number of contributory factors were at work:</p>

<p>1. In none of the years in question did the summer
weather favor an excess of diarrhœal mortality. With
this factor, however, eliminated the infant mortality
each year was lower than in previous years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>2. Although so many husbands were away from
home, in a large proportion of cases the wife, in virtue
of her separation allowance, was financially in a more
favorable position than when she was dependent on
her husband’s wages or such portion of it as he allowed
her for the support of the household.</p>

<p>3. In addition, every soldier became an insured person,
and his wife was therefore entitled to the Maternity
Benefit of 30 shillings on the birth of a child, and
an additional 30 shillings if she was herself an employed
person.</p>

<p>4. There can be no reasonable doubt that the restrictions
on the consumption of alcoholic drinks and
the limitation of hours for opening public houses were
a factor in improving domestic welfare.</p>

<p>But attaching full value to these and other similar
factors which undoubtedly were at work, chief place
must, I think, be given to the awakening of the public
conscience on the subject, and to the concentration on
the mother and her child which had been urged in
season and which now became a fact. An indication
of the public mind is given by the advice issued by the
Local Government Board in August, 1918, which is
quoted on page <a href="#Page_248">248</a>.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
